		<h3 class="chapter-title">I. The Players</h3>

		<p>The art of lawyering is not a science, it's not limited to licensed attorneys, nor is it subject to universal agreement. I began lawyering as a boot Marine Corps Second Lieutenant just graduated from The Basic School and the U.S. Naval Academy. It wasn't until a few years later that I actually graduated from The American University Washington College of Law, passed the bar exams and was licensed to practice law in Virginia and Maryland and waived into the bar of the District of Columbia.</p>

		<p>Many of my Annapolis Navy and Marine contemporaries eventually left the service and became airline pilots. Whether in or out of the service, over the years they have trained for thousands of hours so that they will react appropriately and calmly in the few seconds of crisis that may occur in their aviation careers. At the other extreme, lawyers have no training in crisis management, yet that's part of our legal practice almost every day.</p>

		<p>Who are we lawyers? Our families, friends, neighbors and, most amazingly, total strangers, turn to us with their most personal and consequential matters and we all, both they and us, are confident we can assist them. And, if we're good lawyers, we do assist them. We manage crises. We work the problems. We do the deals. We try the cases. We serve our clients.</p>

		<p>One navigation instructor's first words to my class years ago were: "You can pass this course by scoring 80 percent, but how many of you only want to make it home four out of five times?" In client representation, as in navigation, perfection is the only acceptable goal. The good lawyers' secrets are guideposts that provide some of the lawyering navigational aids to help us always find the harbor lights of home.</p>

		<p>Shakespeare wrote: "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." When we're away from our homes, who lives in our lawyers' world with us? Who are these players we share our stage with? Secretaries and staff, clients, opposing counsel, opposing counsel's clients, judges, clerks, court reporters, media reporters and journalists, the list is seemingly endless. Many of these players are not interested in assisting us and some are downright opposed to us accomplishing our goals for our clients. Yet we need to accomplish our mission and to make it home safely. Our opponents are trying to do the same. In the transactional arenas we perform in, it is easier for both of us to be successful. In the adversarial forums, it's considerably harder.</p>

		<p>What are each of these player's expectations of us and how can we meet theirs as well as our own expectations and aspirations? How can we treat each of them as we want to be treated? How can we balance their competing demands on us and remain true to ourselves and to our clients? In the heat of the lawyering battles we need unwavering principles to guide us steadfastly. In the throes of the storms we need lighthouses and buoys to ensure we steer clear of dangers and distractions as we complete our mission and return home. These good lawyers' secrets are the guideposts that serve those purposes. They serve us all. They serve us well.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Lawyers are the custodians of the ideals of our society.</li>

			<li>Honor, courage, and commitment are the heart and the soul and the body of a lawyer.</li>

			<li>Lawyering is an art, not a science. It takes study, observation and experience to master the art of lawyering.</li>

			<li>Lawyering is difficult. It requires continuous thinking&mdash;one of the things we all find hardest to do.</li>

			<li>Lawyering requires working hard, but it's not hard work. Thinking is hard, but it's not hard work either. I can't define hard work for you, but I know it when I see it. Long hours alone don't define hard work. People who do hard work for a living understand this. You should, too.</li>

			<li>Trust your instincts, especially when interviewing prospective clients.</li>

			<li>Try not to waste too much time thinking about why the other side did or didn't do something.</li>

			<li>Be thankful for those who declare their opposition to you, they are much easier to deal with than those who masquerade as allies.</li>

			<li>In the practice of law you have no friends, only opponents and potential opponents. Forewarned is forearmed.</li>

			<li>Listen to those who disagree with you. It takes courage to confront you, so they may really have a point worth listening to.</li>

			<li>Few counsel can successfully use the media. More often the media use counsel.</li>

			<li>Find out as soon as possible whether the person you are dealing with has the authority to do, or to agree to, what you're proposing. Don't let others take your message or your offer to their decision maker. Demand to present it yourself.</li>

			<li>Trial lawyers have a hard time delegating.</li>

			<li>Be known as the lawyer who makes deals, not breaks them.</li>

			<li>Create and propose legitimate, sound alternatives to get your client the desired result. Think of ways to accomplish things, not reasons why they won't work or can't be done. Be a closer.</li>

			<li>Be known for your good business, as well as good legal judgment. They often are irretrievably intertwined.</li>

			<li>If you listen to what your opponent says, read what your opponent writes, and think about what you've heard and read, then most of the time you'll know what to anticipate and you can plan accordingly.</li>

			<li>Always ask yourself: Is this something I can, and should, do for my client, or would my client be better served if someone else did it? Ask yourself this question not only with respect to others on your staff, whose fees would be less expensive than yours, but also as to lawyers outside your law firm, who may specialize in that legal area.</li>

			<li>If your goal is to persuade someone to do something that you want them to do, then don't be overly concerned with why they do it, if they do what you want them to do.</li>

			<li>Know the preeminent practicing lawyers in the various legal specialties in your local bar well enough so that you can call them, not only to refer cases to them, or to bring them in as specialists in matters you are handling, but also to see whether they agree that you can handle it, when you are considering taking on a new case in their specialty area of practice. If they know you, then they will usually give you their candid opinions. If you do decide to take on the case, they will oftentimes offer to be available for you to call when unusual things happen along the way.</li>

			<li>Don't ask judges for advice, in or out of the courtroom.</li>

			<li>The lawyer has to be the detail person. Check and recheck everything.</li>

			<li>It is important that everyone that you deal with have universal faith in the accuracy of what you say and give to them.</li>

			<li>You are the messenger, not the message.</li>

			<li>Thank fellow lawyers who refer cases to you by taking them to breakfast or lunch. Do not volunteer that you will keep them posted on how the case is going. You have enough things to worry about, don't unnecessarily create more.</li>

			<li>Don't create your own troubles. Leave that to your opponents.</li>

			<li>Be proud of what you do and what you have done for each of your clients. It is your life's work and your personal and professional legacy, not only to your family, but to those who follow you to strive to master the art of lawyering.</li>

			<li>Know who your client is.</li>

			<li>Remember who your client is.</li>

			<li>Only represent your client.</li>

			<li>Don't surprise your client.</li>

			<li>After each prospective client has told you their story, but before you tell them what you think, ask them what they want and why. Their responses may surprise you. After you've found out what they really want, then tell them honestly and realistically whether you can help them get it.</li>

			<li>When a new client leaves your office they should stop worrying about their problem. You should tell them that they need to move on with their lives, to take care of their family and their business, and it is now your job to worry this case. This may be the most therapeutic thing you can do for your clients and the one thing each will remember and appreciate the most, forever.</li>

			<li>Question your client only at a time and in a place where the answers will remain attorney/client-privileged information.</li>

			<li>If you batted .333 for a baseball career you'd be enshrined at Cooperstown, New York, in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Clients know home runs, extra base hits, even singles are hard to get. But if they believe that they had their day in court, and that you gave them three honorable and legitimate swings, with all your best efforts, they'll be satisfied that you served them well, and you will have, regardless of the outcome.</li>

			<li>Don't expect thank you's or kudos from your clients. But savor them when they come.</li>

			<li>If you give your clients your home phone number, then expect they'll call you at home.</li>

			<li>No one but you should provide any information at any time to anybody. Train your staff from the outset that their job is to take in information and to write down questions to pass on to you, but that only you provide any information or answer any questions. There are no gray areas here. This is true, regardless of whether the caller is a client or opposing counsel. Even a frustrated client, once you have explained it to them, should appreciate your diligence and absolute adherence to the attorney/client privilege.</li>

			<li>Don't represent both the husband and the wife in a divorce proceeding, no matter how much they argue for it, nor how simple and straightforward the process may seem. Choose one or the other, and ensure that all documents reflect that spouse as your only client, especially if the other spouse chooses to represent themselves.</li>

			<li>Be very wary of the prospective client who is currently represented by counsel, but shopping around for replacement counsel, unbeknownst to their present counsel.</li>

			<li>Always be alert for potential conflicts of interest. Make a preliminary conflict check as soon as you know the name of the prospective client and the general subject matter of the representation. Resolve all potential conflicts issues before undertaking any representation.</li>

			<li>It's the recognition of the potential conflict of interest that's the hard part. Once identified as a potential conflict of interest, it's usually a straightforward exercise to determine whether or not there is a conflict.</li>

			<li>Be familiar with the names and telephone numbers of the people who run the Federal, State, and local government services, agencies, and programs, as well as the private and not-for-profit organizations, so that you can recommend them to prospective clients who may have no legal remedy but who have definite needs for assistance. Make the initial call for them.</li>

			<li>Lawyering does not require or condone any distraction from your own high moral and ethical standards. Be true to yourself and to those standards, always.</li>

			<li>As a trial lawyer at trial you are a hired gun. If you try to be something more than that, you will be something less.</li>

			<li>The trial lawyer at trial is a one-armed paperhanger, a multi-instrumented street musician and singer, and a one-person movie industry: producer, director, writer, set designer, stagehand, and star performer. Break a leg.</li>

			<li>The court clerk, court reporter, and courtroom marshall are your best indicators of how you are doing at trial. Ask them. Listen to what they say.</li>

			<li>Don't tell the jury that what you say is not evidence for them to consider. Persuade them by everything you do and say that what you say are the most important words they will hear.</li>

			<li>Treat the judge as the first among equals.</li>

			<li>Never assume the judge knows anything.</li>

			<li>If you can't do it sincerely, don't do it. Little children and juries recognize, appreciate, and reward sincerity. Juries punish insincerity.</li>

			<li>Watch other trial lawyers perform. Study their successes and failures. Take as your own whatever you can wear comfortably and naturally. But remember everything takes practice and few things feel comfortable or natural the first time you try them on.</li>

			<li>A trial lawyer is not a good follower.</li>

			<li>The assistance provided to trial lawyers by those in court clerks' offices is immeasurable and generously given. But it is not legal advice and provides you no safe harbor should it prove to be erroneous.</li>

			<li>Choose and use your local counsel wisely. They should be invaluable. Make sure they are.</li>

			<li>Search for and hire the best expert witnesses available and then keep the tightest rein possible on each of them. None of your experts should even think about doing something, writing something, or saying something, and certainly not spending any money, without checking with you first to pre-approve it.</li>

			<li>Avoid familiarity with opposing counsel. Friendly is not a term your client should think of when describing your relationship with your opposing counsel. Civil and respectful, yes; friendly, no.</li>

			<li>In court, argue to the judge about your opponent's arguments, not about your opponent. Judges abhor bickering between counsel.</li>

			<li>Imagine a coin balanced on its edge in the center of a circle, heads facing north and tails facing south. As the trial lawyer you are stationed at one of the poles of the circle and your opponent is at the other. During the trial, the jury is walking around the circle hearing, alternatively, you and then your opponent, describe opposite sides of that same coin. Each of you is arguing accurately what you want the jury to see inside that circle. At the conclusion of the trial the jury will tell you which of you was more persuasive, not what's inside the circle.</li>

			<li>In those jurisdictions where jury instructions precede closing arguments, the lawyer giving the final closing argument has an advantage over their opponent, because the jury stops walking around the circle facing that lawyer's side of the coin, and then retires to deliberate.</li>

			<li>As the trial lawyer you should be the jury's teacher and you should use teaching techniques:

				1. Tell them what's going to happen (opening statement);

				2. Make it happen (direct and cross examination of witnesses; admission of evidence); and,

				3. Tell them what happened (closing argument).</li>

			<li>When your opponent concentrates on the personalities involved (including yours), rather than on the facts, the issues and the law, it usually means that they think you're holding the winning cards and that distracting you is their best strategy. Don't fall for it. Stay on your course and win.</li>

			<li>At trial, the more lawyers there are sitting at opposing counsel's table, the better off you are.</li>

			<li>You don't learn any more about trying cases sitting in the second chair, than you learn about driving cars sitting in the passenger seat.</li>

			<li>A trial lawyer must have the same intensity, ability to focus, and unwavering absolute self-confidence in themselves, their preparation for this moment, and the certainty of their eventual victory as an ace combat pilot in a single-engine jet fighter outnumbered in an aerial dogfight.</li>

			<li>Each individual has their own personal dignity, just as they have their own personal shadow, that varies with the amount and angle of light shining on that person. Our democratic society, and our justice system within our democracy, will only last as long as we continue to recognize that that dignity, even of the weakest or the vilest amongst us, requires our equal treatment of every one of us under our laws. This is the lawyer's gospel. Be prepared to fight and to die for it.</li>
