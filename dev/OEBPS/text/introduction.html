		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>My goal in writing <i>A Good Lawyer</i> was to create a small book to be for all who practice law what Strunk and White's <i>The Elements of Style</i> is for all who write. A book by a lawyer for lawyers on the essence of lawyering. A book to be used by lawyers to help fill in the gaps that we don't currently teach or learn in law school, or find in the rules of evidence or procedure, but that we need to know to practice law and to do it honorably. I hope it also will be used in law schools to give law students some guideposts for practicing law honorably and some compass points for ethics.</p>

		<p>There are approximately 800,000 practicing lawyers in the United States today. Over 50,000 men and women enter law school each year and more than 40,000 become new lawyers each year. This book says as succinctly as I could what I believe is rightfully expected of a good lawyer and hopefully it will be read, considered and talked about by lawyers and law students.</p>

		<p>It is also a book for clients, potential clients and everyone curious about our legal system and legal processes. As we've seen in the last few years already, the conversation in America includes lawyers and lawyering more and more. I've tried here to speak to and about lawyers in useful practical terms that all who read it, whether or not they are lawyers, can understand and immediately use either to reinforce or reconsider their own beliefs or to discus with their own lawyers.</p>

		<p>The reader I always had in mind as I wrote it was a lawyer, of course, but looking over that lawyer's shoulder and also reading it was that lawyer's client. I hope it generates discussions between and among lawyers and our clients about what we should expect from each other.</p>

		<p>Finally, I have included a complete copy of The Constitution of the United States of America as an Appendix. It's our Constitution that makes America so different from everywhere else in our world and every American should remember that it's our American lawyers who guarantee that our Constitutional rights of the citizens and responsibilities of the government are honored. That's what all American lawyers do for all of us, every day.</p>

		<p>Peace be with you.</p>
