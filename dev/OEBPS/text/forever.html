		<ol>
			<li>Protect your family.</li>

			<li>Strive for excellence.</li>

			<li>Excellence without arrogance.</li>

			<li>Excellence with humility.</li>

			<li>Demand respect, don't command it.</li>

			<li>Be patient with those who don't have your knowledge, education, or good fortune.</li>

			<li>Proofread everything you write as if it were going to be on the front page of tomorrow's newspapers.

			<span style="margin-left:15px;display:block;">They prosper who burn in the morning</span>
			<span style="margin-left:15px;display:block;">The letters they wrote overnight.</span>

			<span style="display:block;font-style:italic;text-align:right;">The Laws of the Navy,</span>
			<span style="display:block;font-style:italic;text-align:right;">Admiral Ronald A. Hopwood</span></li>

			<li>Be overprepared.</li>

			<li>Don't always do what you always do.</li>

			<li>As often as possible: <span style="text-decoration:underline">KISS</span><br>
				<span class="acronym"><u>K</u>eep</span>
				<span class="acronym"><u>I</u>t</span>
				<span class="acronym"><u>S</u>hort and</span>
				<span class="acronym"><u>S</u>imple</span>
				</li>

			<li>Don't dip your pen in the company inkwell.</li>

			<li>Your secretary is not your spouse.</li>

			<li>Never assume anything.</li>

			<li>Some like the priest, some like the priest's wife. Learn to recognize the difference.</li>

			<li>Refuse to accept less than your best from yourself.</li>

			<li>Be true to your word.</li>

			<li>If it's important, be shamelessly persistent. Be relentless.</li>

			<li>Treat <i>everyone</i> the way you expect to be treated.</li>

			<li>Never expect anyone to keep a secret. If you are sharing something with them, then expect that they will likewise share it with others.</li>

			<li>There is no such thing as <i>off the record</i> when dealing with the media.</li>

			<li>For most people most of the time, unless you can provide them with a reason why it's in their own best interests to do something, they will prefer to maintain the status quo.</li>

			<li>No record was ever set on a full stomach.</li>

			<li>Know your weaknesses. Work hard either to make them your strengths or to minimize their chance of affecting your success.</li>

			<li>Before you begin writing anything, determine who your reader is. Write only for that reader.</li>

			<li>Keep rewriting until you get it right.</li>

			<li>As soon as you realize that you will be late for any meeting or appointment, call the office where you are scheduled to meet, tell them you will be late, and give them an expected time of arrival.</li>

			<li>Return telephone messages the same day that you receive them.</li>

			<li>Make your own telephone calls.</li>

			<li>Send brief and sincere handwritten thank you letters when people extend courtesies to you. When you receive exceptional service or unusual assistance, remember the names and circumstances and send a letter of praise to that person's employer.</li>

			<li>Keep your sense of humor. It will help sustain you through the hard times and it will help you enjoy the good times even more.</li>

			<li>Use your successes to reinforce your commitment to perfect preparation, and use your setbacks to reinforce your commitment to perfect preparation.</li>

			<li>Take the time to enjoy the satisfaction and fulfillment of each of your successes large or small.</li>

			<li>Where honesty and integrity are concerned, permit yourself no rationalizations. Be vigilant. Honesty and integrity are lost insidiously.</li>

			<li>You can delegate authority, but not responsibility.</li>

			<li>If you're treading water, then you're losing ground.</li>

			<li>If it's important, do it in person.</li>

			<li>Pray.</li>
