		<h3 class="chapter-title">Foreword</h3>

		<p>When a book is republished, the author, assuming still alive and thoughtful, faces the question: Should anything be changed? It is not an easy question to answer. It is a particularly difficult one for lawyers because we have trained ourselves to change things for the better, but we also know we can't rewrite forever. It's a mistake to gild the lily, but not every flower is a lily.</p>

		<p>Harvard Law School Professor Roscoe Pound published his law student primer <i>An Introduction to the Philosophy of Law</i> based upon the Storrs Lectures he delivered to law students at the Law School of Yale University in 1921-22. In his preface to his Revised Edition published in 1953, when he was then a Professor at the University of California at Los Angeles Law School, Professor Pound wrote:</p>

		<blockquote>Problems of philosophy have arisen in the generation since the first edition which have required rethinking of some of the things I said in 1921-22. Likewise discussions and recent theories of legal liability and some features of the law of property and of the law of contract, which have been developed throughout the world in recent decades, have called not only for rewriting of no little but also for considerable additions to the original text.</blockquote>

		<p>Columbia University Law School Professor Karl Llewellyn took a different tack on the question of rewriting and concluded in his Foreword to the 1950 reprinting of his original 1930 primer for law students on the essence of learning the law, <i>Bramble Bush: On Our Law and Its Study</i>:</p>

		<blockquote>As indicated already, and as is developed in the Afterword, this is not the book that I should write today. I feel a lack especially in the failure to get before the reader at the outset the idea of the crafts of the law, of their value to the prospective craftsman, and of his obligation to those crafts. But there is at least this to be said in mitigation: the first craft of the law a man must learn is the craft of the law student; and to that one the lectures as written attempt to give both body and meaning.</blockquote>

		<p>These good lawyers' guideposts grew out of my desire in the early 1990's to collect some of the lawyering lessons I had learned over two decades of lawyering and to share them with others. I began by using them as outlines for my continuing legal education ethics and professionalism lectures to lawyers around the country. By publishing them in book form in 1997 I had initially hoped that these good lawyers' secrets would also "be used in law schools to give law students some guideposts for practicing law honorably and some compass points for ethics," and I wrote exactly that in the book's Introduction.</p>

		<p>Although received by the practicing bar with reasonable favor, these guideposts have not to date, to my knowledge, been regularly used in any law school curriculum. In fact, a few years after publishing them and having received some commendable reviews in the professional press, I sent two books to each of about 15 law school deans inviting them to keep one copy as a gift from me for their library and to pass the other copy on to their appropriate academic decision makers to consider including it somewhere in their law school's curriculum. All but one of those law school deans never responded at all. The single response letter said simply: "There is no place in a law school curriculum for this book."</p>

		<p>For more than ten years now I have been planning and revising a rewrite of my original secrets, and stewing in my own juice over the law school community's apparent universal rejection of my precious guideposts. But now that the opportunity has actually arrived for me to make those major revisions, and perhaps include enough changes to entice law school professors and their law school curriculum coordinators, I have reconsidered and concluded that I have no reason to rewrite. I find myself more in agreement with Professor Llewellyn than with Professor Pound. The seasoned practicing trial lawyer and entrepreneurial small businessman who was simultaneously trying cases, running his law firm, and writing and rewriting these secrets in the mid-1990's knew what he was writing about. He doesn't need nor deserve me rewriting his diary. So I republish his and my good lawyers' secrets with only modest changes as I would normally correct page proofs.</p>

		<p>As to whether this primer for good lawyers should be requisite material for law students to learn, I'm not so certain anymore. Perhaps that's another indication of my different perspective now than when I was in the heat of the battles and first writing them. Perchance those discourteous law school deans who were the recipients of my unsolicited donations and inquiries backed into getting it right. I can accept that so long as their curriculum includes Professor Pound and Professor Llewellyn's law student primers.</p>

		<p>If <i>Bramble Bush</i> is best read, reread, and learned by law school students throughout their law school years, for example, then <i>A Good Lawyer</i> may likewise be best read, reread, and considered by practicing lawyers wanting to learn those crafts of the law, their value to those prospective craftsmen, and their obligations to those crafts that Professor Llewellyn regretted was missing from his law student primer. It would be my greatest legal legacy if, as Professor Pound and Professor Llewellyn's little books are among the books that all good law students have at the ready, my little book is among the books that all good lawyers have at the ready.</p>
