		<h3 class="chapter-title">II. The Tools</h3>

		<p>While I have aggregated these good lawyers' secrets into various chapters in an attempt to give the reader a way of looking at each of them as part of a greater whole, this letterboxing approach is no more reasonable, or unreasonable, than dividing the law itself into separate and distinct law school courses. There are many ways, of course, to subdivide these secrets, or to subdivide the law itself for that matter. I've chosen one approach here; another might seem more reasonable to you. As with the law itself, I hope the form selected won't distract but will enhance their substance.</p>

		<p>Abraham Lincoln once wrote, and it's still true today, not only for good lawyers, but for all who seek success: "The leading rule for the lawyer, as for the man of every other calling, is diligence." But diligence comes with a price: legal fees. But lack of diligence often comes with a higher price: failure. Therein lies just one of the good lawyer's consistent dilemmas: How do you know when you have done enough to be certain of winning? When should you stop preparing? It cannot be put any simpler than Benjamin Franklin did in "Advice to a Young Tradesman, Written by an Old One": "Time is money." Lincoln's lament that "A lawyer's time and advice are his stock in trade," only serves to underscore the good lawyer's problem.</p>

		<p>Clients want cost-effective success and they are not usually concerned with the niceties or nuances of lawyering. Clients hope their lawyers are spending every waking moment only thinking and working on their case, but only charging them for ultimate success, or at least only charging them for substantial progress towards ultimate success. From a client's perspective it's a buyer's market. The sooner all lawyers recognize that we are in a service business and, therefore, the sooner all lawyers force ourselves to serve all our clients, the sooner all our clients will be receptive to entertaining real discussions on the factual, legal, and ethical constraints involved with lawyering. Right now most just don't care.</p>

		<p>This book will serve a useful purpose to the legal profession and to the public if it helps to continue the discussions between and among lawyers and their clients concerning defining good counsel and if those discussions reinforce the bridge of trust and understanding between all clients, not just the best ones, and all their lawyers, not just the good ones.</p>

			<li>Quiet contemplation is not a luxury, but a necessity, for a lawyer.</li>

			<li>You are an artist. Be creative.</li>

			<li>Use legal words and phrases for accuracy only and not for obscuration. Explain the legal terms in layman's terms to make sure your client understands what you're saying.</li>

			<li>Read everything you can. Ideas will come to you while you are reading.</li>

			<li>When you think of something or get an idea write it down as soon as possible, in a stream of consciousness manner, and as much of it as possible. Once you have it written down, then you can start rethinking it, revising it, or critically taking it apart.</li>

			<li>Take notes whenever someone else is providing information, e.g., telephone calls, interviews, depositions, witness testimony. Draw a vertical line from top to bottom dividing each page: two thirds of the page to the left and one third to the right of the line. Write on every other line. Write fast but legibly. Take down, as close to verbatim as you can, what the person is saying on the left side of the vertical line. As ideas for cross-examination, rehabilitation, or areas to probe, etc., come to you, write them on the right side of your vertical line directly across from where you've just written the speaker's relevant statements. [Anything you want to keep to yourself, for whatever reason, put in brackets.]</li>

			<li>Tab, underline, highlight, and write in the margins of your legal texts and books, including this one. Personalize them with your cases, your comments, and your memories. It's part of your legacy.</li>

			<li>Your reputation wins clients. Your performance wins trials. As with a professional golfer, it's only how you perform that matters. No one wins a trial, or a golf tournament, on reputation.</li>

			<li>Your reputation is like your passport. It's critical that it be accurate and up to date. But once it gets you in the door it serves no further purpose. It's only what you do once you're there that counts.</li>

			<li>Good judgment is learned and honed every day. It has little to do with your genes, your wealth, or your status in your community. It has everything to do with what you've learned from what you've done and from what you've seen. Pray for good judgment. It's the lifeblood of good counsel.</li>

			<li>Don't complain and don't whine. Propose constructive alternatives and argue for their adoption.</li>

			<li>Avoid using the fax machine for sensitive material. If you must use it for expediency purposes and your document contains attorney/client-privileged information or anything you'd prefer not to see on the front page of tomorrow's newspapers, then first double-check the telephone number with the prospective recipient and then fax it yourself.</li>

			<li>If you are dealing with sensitive matters, consider whether or not any document, whether paper or electronic, really needs to be created. Consider oral briefings in person, with the client taking no notes.</li>

			<li>Expect that anything entered into any electronic word processing system will be retrievable by your opponents.</li>

			<li>Understand and be able to use by yourself, if necessary, every single thing in your law offices, e.g., word-processing programs, computer systems, telecommunications, networks, postage meter and scale, fax machines. Don't be absolutely dependent upon anyone other than yourself.</li>

			<li>Don't wait for things to happen. As soon as you've accepted a case, make a plan and then begin executing that plan. Massage and retool it as the case progresses to and through completion.</li>

			<li>Develop your own style.</li>

			<li>Be unique without being flamboyant or outrageous.</li>

			<li>All documents that you prepare for legislators and their staff should be written so that they can be inserted, as is, in the member's statements and speeches, legislative and committee reports, as well as the legislation itself. Do the staff and the member's work for them. Don't give them your requests as to what they should do, say, or write; write it yourself precisely the way you want it written or said and give it to them.</li>

			<li>If everyone involved with the legislative process knows that what you give them is always accurate, then you stand the best chance of anyone of having your materials selected and your position accepted, if that's the direction the legislators decide to go.</li>

			<li>By everything you say and do, ensure that your clients and your staff understand that you have no tolerance for dishonesty.</li>

			<li>It's the <i>practice</i> of law and practice makes perfect. Practice every thing you can, every time you can. Practice spontaneity. Practice extemporization. Practice <i>everything</i>.</li>

			<li>Be thankful that you are in a profession with unlimited possibilities to help individuals and society.</li>

			<li>Be a responsible steward of your talents and use your persuasive skills appropriately.</li>

			<li>Leave your mark.</li>

			<li>Before beginning <i>any</i> work, make sure your client understands and agrees with your fee arrangement and billing procedures.</li>

			<li>Have a simple, straightforward, and one-page "Client Information Sheet" that the prospective client can complete before meeting with you for the first time. This should provide you with basic information about the client, their spouse and children, if any, employment and Social Security Number. It should not ask for any information concerning the subject matter of the prospective legal representation.</li>

			<li>Use a tailored "Legal Representation and Fee Agreement Letter" for each client and for each matter. Spell out in that letter from you to your client, at least: what the legal matter is; what the fee arrangement is; how often you will bill; what your expectations and the client's agreements are concerning timing of payments of your bills; any retainer provisions, including interest on retainers and replenishment of retainers; whether your legal representation includes the filing of a lawsuit and trial representation; if so, whether it includes the appeal of any trial court rulings or orders; and, finally, the fact that you have made no promises of success to your client. Explain that costs are not included in legal fees, and that under all circumstances, the client will be responsible for all costs. Emphasize that you will keep costs to a minimum. At the conclusion of the letter and after your signature line, type "SEEN AND AGREED." Go over the Legal Representation and Fee Agreement Letter with your client and if the client agrees, have them sign as such under "SEEN AND AGREED" and date their signature. Keep the original in your file and give your client a copy of the signed letter agreement.</li>

			<li>Keep the originals of the signed Legal Representation and Fee Agreement Letter and the completed Client Information Sheet together and in the same place in every case file.</li>

			<li>As a final check, before you authorize anything that will be passed on to your client as a cost, imagine that your roles are reversed and that you are now the client: Do you want your money spent this way? If you do, then go ahead. If you have to think about it, then you probably don't.</li>

			<li>When counseling prospective clients who have had their employment terminated and are questioning whether they have any legal remedies against their former employer, remember that the loss of their job follows only the loss of a loved one, or a catastrophic physical injury, in its devastating effect on a person. Do all that you can to preserve, or rejuvenate, that person's self-esteem and self-confidence. They should be encouraged to see what has happened to them as an opportunity to move forward, albeit in another direction, and not to become obsessed with "righting this wrong," or "vindicating their reputation." Most of the time there is no legal cause of action against the former employer, since most of us are employees at will, but your counsel needs to go beyond that and to help that person understand and appreciate their continued value to themselves, to their family, and to society, notwithstanding the fact that they don't currently have a job. That is only a temporary condition.</li>

			<li>A lawyer must constantly monitor the appropriate proximity to maintain with each client so that you are balancing the objectivity that distance provides with the subjectivity that closeness provides. That distance is different for each client. Don't get sucked in.</li>

			<li>You do your client a disservice if you cannot maintain your objectivity about their case. Be passionately objective, if you must, but be objective.</li>

			<li>Impress upon your clients who are buying or selling real property, especially homeowners, that it's the <i>contract</i> that's important, not the closing. You should at least be reviewing, if not drafting, any offer they are considering signing.</li>

			<li>The law doesn't provide a remedy for every person's problems. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to help them. Use your talents and your creativity to help people see and take advantage of opportunities for improvement.</li>

			<li>Develop your <i>theory of the case</i> as soon as possible. Before trial keep fine tuning it so that everything you know about the case is compatible with your theory of the case.</li>

			<li>Tailor your theory of the case to fit the <i>facts</i>, not the reverse.</li>

			<li>There are no <i>facts</i> until the finder of facts rests.</li>

			<li>Create and bring your proposed settlement agreement to trial, and if your opponent offers to settle on the courthouse steps, or during trial, make any necessary pen-and-ink changes to your settlement agreement and then execute the agreement right then and there, preferably in front of the trial judge in chambers.</li>

			<li>It ain't over 'til the check's cashed.</li>

			<li>Build your own Model Trial Notebook with tabs for each divisible portion of trial preparation and presentation, e.g., legal research, discovery, opening, witnesses, exhibits, closing, instructions. Whenever you read something that you agree with, cut it out and put it in your Model Trial Notebook. Then, read and reread your Model Trial Notebook.</li>

			<li>Keep a separate trial notebook for each case you have, with tabs and sections that mirror your Model Trial Notebook. Start it when you open the casefile.</li>

			<li>Create your jury instructions as soon as possible. Keep them in your trial notebook and keep revising them as the case becomes clearer and as your theory of the case crystallizes.</li>

			<li>Object and fight ferociously to keep matters from the jury that are detrimental to your client or to your theory of the case. Otherwise, even if they are technically objectionable, don't object. Pick your fights.</li>

			<li>Don't expect much more in answers to written interrogatories than names and addresses of the people involved and descriptions of the documents involved. No matter how artful your written interrogatories are, opposing counsel will usually try to find ways either to object or to provide nonresponsive answers. Therefore, realistically, the best use of written interrogatories is to determine who to depose and what documents to request be produced.</li>

			<li>Use requests for admissions continuously and exhaustively. Write short, simple factual statements that provide no wriggle room for opposing counsel. The more you can get your opponent to admit, the less you will have to prove.</li>

			<li>If you have any doubt as to whether any of the witnesses might not be at the civil trial, then take their <i>de benne esse</i> deposition prior to trial.</li>

			<li>Use creative motions <i>in limine</i> to disrupt your opponent's theory of the case, to narrow the issues as much as possible, and to solidify your own theory of the case.</li>

			<li>Don't take video depositions unless they are cost justified.</li>

			<li>Unlike the civil trial court judge, the chancellor in equity is not so bound by precedent and caselaw that they are required to decide a particular case a certain way. Requesting equitable remedies in your pleadings may lower the blindfold of Lady Justice just enough for the court to be able to craft sensible resolutions to the specific issues before it.</li>

			<li>Create a "Trial Exhibit and Trial Testimony Table" for each case and continue to update it through trial. On the left margin separately list all the elements you will need evidence admitted on to prove your theory of the case. Across the top of that page, list all your witnesses. Draw horizontal lines between each of the elements you have to prove, and draw vertical lines between each of your witnesses. Write, in the appropriate boxes in this Table, the testimony expected and the exhibits that will be introduced and authenticated by each of your witnesses. Be prepared for objections and, if possible, have alternative witness testimony and methods of introduction ready to use, if necessary. At trial, and after each witness has testified appropriately and after each exhibit has been admitted, draw a line through that statement or exhibit. Stay in direct examination of each witness until you have drawn a line through each entry in the column under their name in your Table. Do not rest your case until evidence has been admitted on each element in your theory of your case.</li>

			<li>Remember, on direct examination at trial since you usually can't ask leading questions, it's the witness's <i>answers</i> that are important, not your <i>questions</i>. So a list of the <i>testimony</i> needed from each of your witnesses, found for example in your Trial Exhibit and Trial Testimony Table, is much more helpful for you to have and use during trial, than a list of the <i>questions</i> to ask your witnesses.</li>

			<li>When defending the accused in a criminal case, the best that anyone may be able to do is negotiate a lesser punishment based upon a plea bargain to a lesser included offense. That alone may be a monumental success. But you may be the only one who ever knows or appreciates it.</li>

			<li>Before sending them, proofread your bills from your client's perspective: Service; Satisfaction; Success.</li>

			<li>Use a seven digit client/matter filing system: the first four digits for clients/the last three digits for matters for each client. E.g., 0050/004 is the fourth matter <i>(ABC Co. v. D)</i>, for the 50th client (ABC Co.).</li>

			<li>Keep your files alphabetically indexed by client.</li>

			<li>Keep a "Pleadings File" that is indexed and only has in it documents that are in the court's file for that case.</li>

			<li>At the same time(s) as you create and then update your own Pleadings File, provide your client with their own continually updated Pleadings File, including file folders, tabs, index and the pleadings themselves.</li>

			<li>Keep a "Correspondence File" that is indexed and only has communications (letters, e-mails, notes of telephone conversations, faxes, etc.) in it related to that case.</li>

			<li>Staple business cards of persons related to a particular case on the inside of the left side of the Correspondence File. Write additional names, addresses, and telephone numbers there as well.</li>

			<li>Keep a "Data File" that is indexed and that includes everything else related to that case.</li>

			<li>Use a <i>tickler</i> file religiously. Check it yourself every day to ensure that what needs to be completed that day gets done that day.</li>

			<li>Whenever you take on a new case or matter, don't put the file down until you've satisfied yourself that you know what the statute of limitations is and then make the appropriate tickler file entries, including, especially, the date the statute of limitations expires, and prior warnings to yourself that leave enough time for you to do all that needs to be done prior to that statute's expiration date.</li>

			<li>Keep a "Chronological File" of everything you create and write, filed in reverse chronological order: most recent on top.</li>

			<li>Hourly fee arrangements may not be the best fee structure for a particular legal matter. Explore alternatives with your client before settling on any fee arrangement.</li>

			<li>Tailor each document you create to the needs of that client and that matter. Only use standard forms to assist you in creating the document your client needs.</li>

			<li>Checklists are better than standard forms. Collect checklists from every source available and combine them with your own to create master checklists that you can use, and reuse, to craft the appropriate documents for each situation.</li>
