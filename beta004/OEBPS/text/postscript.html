		50 Ways Clients Can Tell If They Have A Good Lawyer</h3>

		<p>Good lawyers recognize other good lawyers. They can be found in every jurisdiction, in every courthouse, and in every law firm in the Country. But how can clients find a good lawyer? How does a client spot and cut a good lawyer from the rest of the herd? Are there similar traits and principles that all good lawyers try to follow? I think there are.</p>

		<p>I also think that if clients know what those traits and principles are and look for them in their own lawyers, they will have objective ways to measure their own lawyer's good lawyering skills. This objective analysis should be done simultaneously with their subjective measurement of their own lawyer's successes concerning that particular matter. But just as in any tournament, the top-seeded player or team might not actually win that tournament. Likewise, a good lawyer will not always prevail. But if they don't prevail, it won't be for lack of preparation or for lack of trying. There may be another good lawyer on the other side of that case, for example, and they both can't achieve their separate client's conflicting goals. There's also the small matter of the facts at hand. Sometimes you just don't have good facts. There's only so much even a good lawyer can do with bad facts.</p>

		<p>So for you readers who have been clients, who are now clients, or who may someday (perhaps sooner than you'd wish) become a lawyer's client, here are 50 ways to find out how high you would rank your lawyer on basic good lawyering skills. Before you start, however, remember two universal truths: things are not usually as simple as they first seem to be, and, nobody's perfect.</p>

		<p>With those final words of caution I invite you to compare your lawyer with these objectiveï¿¼standards. So that we're all clear on what I've done here, I've taken some of the guideposts from A Good Lawyer and restated them as traits and principles you should look for in your lawyer. If you've personally had a lawyer, or now have a lawyer, I'm optimistic that you'll find that not only are you personally satisfied, or even very satisfied, with your own lawyer's work, but that you will also rank your lawyer, objectively, as a good lawyer, too. That's because most lawyers really are good lawyers.</p>

		<p>Here then are some of the traits and principles of a good lawyer.</p>

		<p class="title-break"><span>*</span><span>*</span><span>*</span></p>

		<p>A good lawyer:</p>

		<ol>

			<li>Is always honest and truthful.</li>

			<li>Listens; and speaks sincerely, or not at all.</li>

			<li>Is the messenger, not the message.</li>

			<li>Knows who the client is, remembers who the client is, only represents the client, and doesn't surprise the client.</li>

			<li>Keeps the client aware of developments in a timely manner.</li>

			<li>Returns the client's phone calls and inquiries promptly.</li>

			<li>Proposes legitimate and sound alterna-tives to get the client to the desired end result and argues for their adoption. Makes deals, doesn't break them. A good lawyer is a closer.</li>

			<li>Asks the client what the client wants and why. After hearing that answer, a good lawyer then tells the client whether that lawyer believes they can help the client achieve those goals.</li>

			<li>Is willing to tell the client that the law sometimes doesn't offer a remedy to every particular problem.</li>

			<li>After hearing the situation and accepting the responsibilities of taking on the case, a good lawyer then tells the client that is it that lawyer who will now worry that problem, not that client anymore, and that that client needs to move on to protect and preserve their family, their job, and their work.</li>

			<li>Never underestimates an opponent and never embarrasses anyone.</li>

			<li>Has a positive attitude, is enthusiastic and creative, but does not promise success.</li>

			<li>Explains everything discussed in terms that the client can understand and doesn't use legal terms without explaining them.</li>

			<li>Has a good reputation with their fellow lawyers and in the local community in general.</li>

			<li>Doesn't wait for things to happen, but has a flexible plan and begins executing that plan as soon as reasonably possible.</li>

			<li>Is unique, but not flamboyant or outrageous.</li>

			<li>Before beginning any work, makes sure the client understands and agrees with the fee arrangements and the billing proce-dures. A good lawyer uses simple and easily understood written legal representation and fee agreements tailored to each client, bills understandably based upon those fee agreements and then stands behind those bills.</li>

			<li>Sets and meets deadlines or explains why they're not being met.</li>

			<li>Normally uses checklists, rather than standard forms, to create the appropriate business documents.</li>

			<li>Shares with the client the lawyer's decisions and thought processes concerning the moral and ethical issues presented in addition to the legal and factual ones.</li>

			<li>Quickly becomes the most knowledgeable person about the facts in the case and even while settling the case does not assume a settlement attitude.</li>

			<li>Is shamelessly persistent and relentless in their pursuit of what is important.</li>

			<li>Has a sense of humor and keeps it.</li>

			<li>Questions their client only at a time and in a place where the answers will remain attorney/client-privileged information and always honors the attorney/client privilege.</li>

			<li>Understands that lawyering requires working hard, but that it's not hard work. Long hours alone don't define hard work. People who do hard work for a living understand this and good lawyers do, too.</li>

			<li>Treats everyone with the same respect and dignity that that lawyer expects to be treated with.</li>

			<li>Is civilized with and respectful to opposing counsel, but not familiar or friendly with them.</li>

			<li>Treats the judge as the first among equals.</li>

			<li>Never assumes anything and especially never assumes the judge knows anything.</li>

			<li>Doesn't ask judges for advice in or out of the courtroom.</li>

			<li>At trial has the same intensity, ability to focus, and unwavering absolute self-confidence in themselves, their preparation for that moment, and the certainty of their victory as an ace combat pilot in a single-engine jet fighter outnumbered in an aerial dogfight.</li>

			<li>Strives for excellence. Excellence without arrogance. Excellence with humility.</li>

			<li>Is patient with those who don't have that lawyer's knowledge, education, or good fortune.</li>

			<li>Is proud of being a lawyer and how they have served each of their clients.</li>

			<li>Has good judgment, the lifeblood of good counsel, and is known for their good business, as well as good legal judgment.</li>

			<li>Is wary of the prospective client who is currently represented by counsel, but shopping around for replacement counsel, unbeknownst to their present counsel.</li>

			<li>Is always alert for potential conflicts of interest and investigates and resolves all potential conflicts issues before undertaking any representation.</li>

			<li>Understands that good lawyering does not require or condone any distraction from their own high personal, professional, moral, and ethical standards.</li>

			<li>Is thankful that they are in a profession with unlimited possibilities to help individuals and society.</li>

			<li>Is a responsible steward of their talents and uses their persuasive skills appropriately.</li>

			<li>Leaves their mark.</li>

			<li>Continuously monitors the appropriate proximity to maintain with each client to balance the objectivity that distance provides with the subjectivity that closeness provides and understands that that distance is different for each client.</li>

			<li>Maintains their objectivity about the client's case. Good lawyers may be passionate about their cases, but they remain objective.</li>

			<li>Takes a break from their legal practice, as much and as often as they can.</li>

			<li>Leaves something on the table at settlement, but takes no prisoners at trial.</li>

			<li>Knows when to move on.</li>

			<li>Has faith in the legal system, but remembers that it's a hands-on operation whose best results occur when that lawyer's hands control it.</li>

			<li>Doesn't let the possibility or probability of future appearances, either before the same judge or against the same opposing counsel, affect their zealous representation of their current client.</li>

			<li>Encourages the client to continue to trust the client's own instincts and to question the lawyer when the client is unsure of what or why things are or are not happening.</li>

			<li>Knows that our democratic system and our justice system within our democracy will only last as long as we all continue to recognize that the personal dignity of each individual, even of the meekest or the vilest amongst us, requires our equal treatment of every one of us under our laws. This is the good lawyer's gospel. American lawyers are prepared to fight and to die for it.</li>

		</ol>

		<p class="title-break"><span>*</span><span>*</span><span>*</span></p>

		The inescapable conclusion about a good lawyer is that the more a client knows about and works with that lawyer the more comfortable and confident that client becomes with that lawyer and especially with that lawyer's competence to handle that matter for that client.
