		<h3 class="chapter-title">III. The Venues</h3>

		<p>In l903, the well-known New York trial lawyer, Francis L. Wellman, first published his now-legendary and undisputed classic, <i>The Art of Cross-Examination</i>. Borrowing from the original preface to that legal masterpiece, I, too, suggest that I am more a messenger than a creator:</p>

		<blockquote>In offering this book to the legal profession, I do not intend to arrogate to myself any superior knowledge upon the subject, excepting in so far as it may have been gleaned from actual experience. Nor have I attempted to treat the subject in any scientific, elaborate, or exhaustive way; but merely to make some suggestions upon the art of [lawyering], which have been gathered as a result of twenty-five years [of lawyering] during which time I have [represented clients] drawn from all classes of the community.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>If what is here written affords anything of instruction to the younger members of my profession, or of interest and entertainment to the public, it will amply justify the time taken from my summer vacation to put in readable form some points from my experience upon this most difficult subject.</blockquote>

		<p>It is sometimes said that, when discussing lawyering, one must make a distinction between those involved in a private-type practice and those involved in a corporate environment; and that is often the case. However, I have not here tried to cut so fine a slice. If some of the good lawyer's secrets and guideposts herein do not apply to you or to your practice, then just read on. If you're a practicing lawyer, you'll be back on the orienteering course in a few moments.</p>

		<p>Good lawyers recognize other good lawyers. They can be found in every jurisdiction, in every courthouse, and in every law firm in the country. But how can clients find one? How does a client spot and cut a good lawyer from the rest of the herd? Apparently Ralph Waldo Emerson must have needed a good lawyer one time, too. His thoughtful advice to other prospective clients, in <i>The Conduct of Life</i>, is worth considering: "The good lawyer is not the man who . . . qualifies all his qualifications, but who throws himself on your part so heartily that he can get you out of a scrape." Good lawyers will do that for their clients. Every time. Everywhere.</p>

		<ol>

			<li>It's [<i>always</i>] Showtime.</li>

			<li>At settlement: Leave something on the table. At trial: Take no prisoners.</li>

			<li>Take a break from your practice, as much and as often as you can.</li>

			<li>Know when to move on.</li>

			<li>Sometimes the best thing you can do for a prospective client is to listen to their story. There are not always legal remedies for every wrong. Sometimes people just need your concurrence that they have been wronged and your encouragement to press on. Even for that person, you still have performed a valuable service, because now they truly can move on with their lives and not forever be upset with themselves for failing to file a lawsuit, misbelieving that it would have had some possibility of success.</li>

			<li>If you think your prospective client has the facts to change the law in your jurisdiction on some point, before you suggest that course of action, carefully consider whether your client, and you, have the wherewithal and the determination to see the case through to its trial and appellate courts' completion. It may be better to bring in a legal gadfly organization at the outset, or to not accept the case at all, than to begin and then later find out, for whatever reason, that you're not able to complete the mission.</li>

			<li>Have faith in the legal system, but remember it's a hands-on operation, and the best results occur when your hands are controlling it.</li>

			<li>Each law firm, from the smallest to the largest, has a tone or a morality to it that is consciously set by those in power at that firm. That firm's moral tone is usually well-known within its own local legal community. It remains constant, because attorneys comfortable with that morality seek employment at that firm and those uncomfortable with it either avoid working there, or leave once they recognize their incompatibility with it.</li>

			<li>When leaving the private practice of law, investigate the costs of purchasing from your malpractice insurer the <i>tail</i> to your policy. It's usually cost efficient and provides protection for claims based on past legal representations. Do everyone a favor and stay covered.</li>

			<li>The practice of law is a calling, it is not a job. If it becomes just a job, consider refocusing your practice areas to reinspire yourself.</li>

			<li>Don't become such a specialist that you have truly put all of your eggs in one basket. Develop and maintain several areas of legal expertise so that no changes in statute, caselaw, or the economy can make you obsolete. Likewise, don't depend upon one client for too much of your firm's income.</li>

			<li>Lobbying requires more objectivity in your oral presentations and in your advocacy documents than does trial lawyering because the legislative process does not provide an opposing advocate who is aware of and who can question everything you say or write as the judicial process does.</li>

			<li>Lobbying requires different persuasion and advocacy skills than trial lawyering because the legislative process is different than the judicial process. In the courtroom there are rules of procedure, rules of evidence, instructions to the jury, a judge and a marshal to make sure everyone is following the rules and paying attention to what's happening along the way with no distractions. There is a requirement that a verdict be delivered in a timely fashion; and there is a definite judicial appeal process and a final decision. Legislators, on the other hand, are bound by no rules of any real consequence, are not required to pay attention to the issues at hand, are always distracted because they are always running for office, often vote on a particular piece of legislation for reasons totally unrelated to that legislation, regularly ignore time requirements, and have no legislative appeal process for the members on the losing side once a bill is passed.</li>

			<li>A <i>level playing field</i> doesn't exist. Don't expect one and don't bother arguing for one.</li>

			<li>As a trial lawyer you should always try to settle your case, because by definition your client can live with a settlement they have agreed to. On the other hand, if you try the case and lose, the court's decision may include something your client really can't live with.</li>

			<li>Before filing or responding to a divorce proceeding, encourage your client to consider whether they want to reconcile and preserve the marriage.</li>

			<li>Encourage your clients to avoid real estate agents who will only propose what they've done before&#8212;or as I usually say&#8212;those who only know what they know. (And are unwilling to learn, or even consider, a different approach.)</li>

			<li>Crafting an antenuptial (premarital) agreement for one of your clients about to be married may put your future lawyer-client relationship in jeopardy after the marriage. Don't expect that your client will defend you if it later gets too hot in the marital kitchen. <i>C'est la guerre</i>.</li>

			<li>If you can't take on a prospective client's case, but you believe there may be some substance to their claim worth pursuing, then give them the names of several lawyers who are familiar with that legal specialty and tell them to use your name when contacting any of those lawyers.</li>

			<li>A trial is theater with consequences.</li>

			<li>Just as a screenwriter must require every word have a reason to be spoken, at trial everything you do and say must support your theory of the case.</li>

			<li>In the courtroom, as in life, be careful what you ask for. You might get it.</li>

			<li>In the preparation for and presentation of a trial, there are decisions made, and forks in the road taken, every day. Once you've decided to go a certain way, don't look back or second guess yourself.</li>

			<li>The life of a case through its preparation and then presentation at trial is a roller coaster ride. Don't dwell on either the highs or the lows along the way. It's only the result that counts.</li>

			<li>A trial lawyer <i>expects</i> to win, but <i>knows</i> and <i>understands</i> that it might not happen.</li>

			<li>Take depositions of opposing counsel's witnesses at their workplace, office, or other place:

					<ol>

						<li>Where they will feel most comfortable;</li>

						<li>Where you will have the best chance that they will ramble on in their answers to your questions; and,</li>

						<li>Where, if they refer to a document in their answer, you will be in the best position to take a brief recess in the deposition to have them get it and then continue with the deposition as seamlessly as possible.</li>

					</ol>
				
				</li>

			<li>Do not consider future appearances, either before the same judge or against the same opposing counsel, in pursuing your zealous representation of your client. An enlightened bench and bar will understand your obligations to your current client and respect you for honoring them.</li>

			<li>Visit and explore a courtroom unfamiliar to you, before you are called upon to perform in it. Sit in the jury box, the witness chair, and the judge's chair to see their views and lines of sight and to hear how well sound travels to and from them.</li>

			<li>Arrive early enough on the first day of a jury trial to claim the counsel table closest to the jury. Don't relocate unless the judge requires it.</li>

			<li>Make, and document, sincere reasonable efforts to work out all discovery issues outside of the courtroom. But no matter how meritorious your complaints about opposing counsel are, expect that the judge will be unmoved by them.</li>

			<li>Punish opposing counsel for intransigence and unreasonableness by beating them unmercifully in court on the merits of the case, not by asking the judge to sanction them.</li>

			<li>At depositions, especially those taken outside your regular geographical area of practice, do not agree to "the usual preliminary understandings." If opposing counsel has something specific in mind, have them propose it to you on the record and then either agree to it or don't, also on the record.</li>

			<li>Before any depositions are taken, know whether or not, in that jurisdiction, deposition testimony can be used to support motions for summary judgment.</li>

			<li>Either you, or your local counsel, should select your court reporter for depositions. Do not let your opposing counsel select a court reporter for <i>your</i> depositions.</li>

			<li>Agree to the rates for the court reporter's services, e.g., original transcript and one copy, additional copies, an electronic version of the transcript, travel costs, etc., before you hire the court reporter. Have the court reporter send you those rates in writing, so you can bring them with you to the deposition. Confirm with the court reporter, before starting the deposition, the rates agreed to.</li>

			<li>If you are ever going to be late for a court appearance, and hopefully this will never occur, call the judge's chambers as soon as you realize it and give them a reason why you will be late and an expected time of arrival at the court. Trial lawyers are prepared and punctual, always. Being late sends the wrong message to the court, to your client, and to your opponents.</li>

			<li>The last vestige remaining in our society today of the feudal concept of one person having absolute dominion and control over their own fiefdom is the trial court judge in their own courtroom.</li>

			<li>If you want to be a good trial lawyer, then get into a busy prosecutor's shop, or a busy public defender's shop, right out of law school for a trial lawyering internship. Be famous at that office for taking on more cases than anyone else, for taking the cases no one else wants, and for dedicating yourself to your cases. Live at the courthouse every day. Try as many cases to a jury as possible and as often as possible.</li>

			<li>Spend at least as long as it took you to get through law school and pass the bar in this trial lawyering internship. It will pay you dividends for the rest of your life, whether or not you ever try another criminal case again. And whether or not you ever try a civil case. You will not only never forget how to ride this trial lawyering bicycle, but you will have learned and perfected bicycle riding like a circus performer. Trials will forever be just another day at the office for you.</li>

			<li>Expect that at least one of the parties will raise a new issue at closing or attempt to revisit a settled issue. Even so, don't let the deal fall apart at closing, unless it's your client that's trying to back out. If that's the case, then at the earliest possible time determine whether or not you really want to continue to represent that client.</li>

			<li>Praise in public. Criticize in private.</li>

			<li>Whether it's praise or criticism, tell your staff your conclusions, give them a chance to respond, listen to what they say, then make sure everyone moves on.</li>
