		<h3 class="chapter-title">IV. The Rules</h3>

		<p>My goals in writing this book were threefold.</p>

		<p>First, I wanted to provide to counselors, whether seasoned or not, some secrets of good lawyers that are seemingly arbitrarily scattered around the lawyering landscape. They seem obvious to me now, and known by all good lawyers, but they weren't so obvious to me along the way to today. They were usually learned first-hand, in the lawyering arena itself. Some may trigger personal memories in lawyers' and readers' minds of their own experiences that have led them to similar conclusions. Perhaps younger members of my profession can learn some of them without the pain.</p>

		<p>Second, I wanted to provide to all clients help in recognizing good lawyering skills in their own counsel. From a client's perspective, there is no substitute for good counsel, but unfortunately in the heat of the civil or criminal battle, any advice or strategy may seem sensible at the time. Most clients, especially new clients, don't have a yard- stick to measure their counsel against, or the time or resources for a second legal opinion. If all clients, not just the good lawyers' best clients, are also aware of some of these same legal secrets, then all clients can more easily recognize when the counsel they receive is on course and on glidepath and when it is not.</p>

		<p>Finally, I wanted to show some of the tension involved in the lawyer-client dynamic that is not often discussed. In that very fluid relation- ship there may not be a real appreciation by one for what's driving the other, or any true understanding of what each can and can't do or will and won't do. One definition of good lawyers might include: With their heads in the clouds and their feet on the ground, but in the shoes of their clients. As you read the good lawyer's counsel in these pages, think of each of these good lawyer's secrets as a guidepost located somewhere on a continuum from heavenly idealism to pedestrian pragmatism.</p>

		<p>The client is a reality check for the lawyer and, likewise, the lawyer for the client. Good lawyers know that the ends alone cannot justify the means. This conflict, only one among many potential lawyer-client conflicts, often causes tension at the nexus of the lawyer-client relationship. Hopefully, the awareness of these good lawyer's guideposts by all clients will help them and their lawyers to appreciate that tension and use it to strengthen and not weaken the relationship.</p>

		<p>Law school professors use what they call the Socratic Method to teach law students the law. Students' questions are answered by the law professors with other questions asked back to the students. This Socratic Method, at its best, forces the law students to think themselves through to their own questions' answers. On the other hand, medical school students use rote memorization to learn for themselves as much medical lore as the medical schools then think is known.</p>

		<p>Whether the schooling influences the practice, or the practice drives the schooling is academic, but for each of these professions, legal and medical, the results, as seen by the lawyers' clients and the physicians' patients, are quite different. Lawyers spend seemingly endless hours researching, writing, theorizing, strategizing, rewriting, and thinking. Physicians, on the other hand, even the most otherwise sensible and cerebral ones, often prescribe from the hip and diagnose on the run, as if each patient were an emergency room situation. Yet good physicians do have one rule they follow above all others. The same first rule that good lawyers also prescribe to. It comes from The Physician's Oath, first delivered by Hippocrates, and still sensible counsel for all good physicians and for all good lawyers twenty-four hundred years later: First do no harm.</p>

		<ol>

			<li>Not everything requires a Supreme Court brief.</li>

			<li>Try not to equivocate.</li>

			<li>Never underestimate your opponent.</li>

			<li>Don't make idle threats, it undermines your credibility.</li>

			<li>Don't embarrass your opponent.</li>

			<li>On a weekly basis, review all your open matters to ensure that each one is being worked appropriately and that nothing has fallen through the cracks.</li>

			<li>Never promise success to your client.</li>

			<li>Remember the attorney/client privilege. Is there a "need to know?" Loose lips sink ships.</li>

			<li>Ignore prospective clients' assurances to you that the prospective defendants: "Will cave in as soon as they know there is a lawyer involved;" "Will settle because they can't afford any bad publicity;" "Have always settled cases like this in the past;" and that the prospective clients have heard that similarly situated predecessors "Settled for a 'bundle' of money and never even had to file any lawsuit." Suggest to those prospective clients that if any of that is actually true, then they should be hiring the lawyers who accomplished those results, and not you.</li>

			<li>Ignore earlier counsel freely given to prospective clients by other lawyers that they may have talked with who have "confirmed" that the client does, in fact, have a "great case" or "great facts," but, for whatever reason, those lawyers are unable or unwilling to represent that prospective client. Again, suggest to those prospective clients that if their case were such a sure thing those same lawyers would have handed it off themselves, and not put the onus back on the client to find appropriate counsel.</li>

			<li>Keep an accurate, detailed, and updated accounting of the law firm's trust account(s) such that it could be produced on a moment's notice. Train yourself to understand and believe that your continued professional life could depend on such an instantaneous and accurate production of that accounting.</li>

			<li>Ensure that the law firm's checking account never has any client's money in it. Never commingle any client's funds with your own. Never. Not even for a moment.</li>

			<li>If you decide not to take on a case after meeting with a prospective client, then either in person or by telephone:

					<ol>

						<li>Tell them that you're not going to be able to represent them;</li>

						<li>Tell them why you've come to that conclusion;</li>

						<li>Encourage them to meet with and to seek the opinions of other lawyers; and,</li>

						<li>Remind them of the statute(s) of limitations that may be involved.</li>

					</ol>

				</li>

			<li>Follow that conversation with a letter to them to the same effect. Include with that letter, as enclosures, the originals of all documents the prospective client may have left with you to review. Also, include as a statement in that letter that you have kept no copies of any documents except a copy of this letter. During your conversation, ask the prospective client if they would prefer to come to your offices and pick up your letter and their documents rather than have you mail them. Do whichever one the prospective client wants.</li>

			<li>Understand that sometimes you, or your staff, will become the target for abuse from everyone, including your client, for reasons that have nothing to do with you or your counsel, but just because you're available and they're frustrated. This, too, will pass.</li>

			<li>As each case progresses, share with your client your decisions and your thought processes concerning the moral and ethical issues presented, in addition to the legal and factual ones.</li>

			<li>Don't let any misguided loyalty to your client undermine your loyalty to yourself, your ideals, your family, and your profession.</li>

			<li>Anticipate your opponent's counter-arguments, but don't unnecessarily address them before they're made.</li>

			<li>At trial, only ask questions to which you know the answers. And don't stop asking until you get those answers.</li>

			<li>Don't accept nonresponsive replies from witnesses or deponents. Keep asking the question until it is answered or the Court makes you move on, making an objection for the record before you do.</li>

			<li>Learn when to stop asking questions. Once you get your answer, move on. Don't gild the lily.</li>

			<li>Do not assume a settlement attitude.</li>

			<li>An Asian expression translates: Talk, Talk, Fight, Fight. To me that means once the lawsuit has been filed, and especially when you are discussing settlement, keep the trial preparation pedal to the metal.</li>

			<li>Unless you have something to say, don't say anything. Let your opponent, the witness, or the deponent fill the silence. It will pay off.</li>

			<li>There is no magic to mastering the facts, the issues, and the law concerning any case. It just takes all your time.</li>

			<li>Life is what's happening while you're trying cases.</li>

			<li>Know more about the case, including the smallest, seemingly most irrelevant details, than anyone. Not only know more about the case than your opponents, of course, but also know more about it than your own expert witnesses.</li>

			<li>Prepare your witnesses for depositions with the same zeal and precautionary instructions that you use for witness trial preparation.</li>

			<li>Don't expect the judge to take sides between counsel; rather, expect the judge to criticize both counsel for inappropriate conduct, regardless of the actual facts of the disagreement between counsel.</li>

			<li>During depositions, listen to what the deponent says and then ask follow-on questions based upon the deponent's answers to your questions, in addition to those based upon your prepared areas of inquiry.</li>

			<li>At depositions, ask simple and straightforward questions. Remember, it's an information discovery process, not a trial performance.</li>

			<li>There is no need for exaggerated theatrics at depositions.</li>

			<li>Don't be afraid to use Biblical, literary, or historical references to make your points to the jury, especially in closing. Using such stories and references can put your case into a framework that the jury is familiar with and that they can understand and relate to.</li>

			<li>Have one calendar that has all of your professional as well as personal schedules and obligations on it. Always bring that calendar to court with you.</li>

			<li>It's hard for trial lawyers to empathize with judges, since most trial lawyers have never been judges. But as former trial lawyers, most judges recognize and appreciate good trial counsel and understand the conflicting demands made upon lawyers.</li>

			<li>The critical question is not whether a civil case of yours will settle, since most civil cases do settle, but: For what amount will it settle? The best insurance policy available to guarantee that your case will settle for your best number is perfectly preparing yourself for trial.</li>

			<li>There is a difference between having a motions practice and having a real trial practice. But since most well-prepared cases settle, even the best trial lawyers sometimes, therefore, wind up with a motions practice.</li>

			<li>There is a difference between a litigator and a trial lawyer. Be the trial lawyer.</li>

			<li>When defending the accused in a homicide case, your best theory of the case, albeit often unspoken, may be: The deceased deserved to die and my guy was the right guy for the job.</li>

			<li>In a criminal defense case, your potential client, the accused, decides:

				<ol>

					<li>Whether to plead guilty or not guilty;</li>
					
					<li>Whether or not to plea bargain and if so what to accept;</li>
					
					<li>Whether or not to take the stand and testify; and,</li>

					<li>Whether or not to appeal any conviction.</li>

				</ol>

				All other matters should be ultimately decided by you as counsel, e.g., strategies, theory of the case, defense(s) to use or abandon, objections. If your prospective client is unwilling to agree to this arrange- ment, strongly consider not beginning the relationship.

				</li>			

			<li>As the criminal defense counsel, do not concede anything. Make the prosecutor prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of every offense charged against your client.</li>

			<li>It's the prosecutor's job at trial, not the criminal defense counsel's, to create an error-free trial record.</li>

			<li>It's the criminal defense counsel's job at trial to achieve a finding of not guilty for your client, not to intentionally introduce errors at the trial court level to be later argued on appeal.</li>

			<li>Criminal defense counsel who have never been prosecutors are more cynical of and have less faith in the criminal justice system than those who once were prosecutors.</li>

			<li>It is no exaggeration to say that, as the accused's criminal defense counsel, you are all that stands between that accused and the State or the Federal government's oftentimes massive police and prosecution machinery. Be the zealous advocate for that accused who you would want defending you if your roles were reversed.</li>

			<li>If a client offers to pay you now or later, choose now.</li>

			<li>Leave it at the office.</li>

			<li>Don't join anything for possible client acquisition reasons, join&mdash;and participate&mdash;because you enjoy and support the activity.</li>

			<li>No loose pages. For want of a nail the Kingdom was lost.</li>

			<li>If it's costing your client money, remember the law of diminishing returns.</li>

			<li>Have an office celebration tradition, including toasts, to share successes with your staff.</li>

			<li>No one should ever answer a call from the media or the press except you.</li>

			<li>As often as possible tell your secretary and your staff why you are doing what you are doing. Forcing yourself to explain the reasoning of your decisions not only helps to ensure that you've thought them through, but also provides your staff with a better understanding of what it is that you expect from them.</li>

			<li>Help your client understand why it may be shortsighted to allow the other side to prepare the initial document. In the Battle of the Forms versus the Battle of the Bills discussions with your client, you should understand that your client's argument is that the legal bills are real and must be paid now, whereas your proposed document language, anticipating possible hypotheticals and determining now how to deal with them, may be a lesser priority to your client. Work hard and efficiently to find the compromise language that reasonably protects your client, but that's not overkill or overbill.</li>

			<li>It is the unusual business deal that is driven by tax purposes or principally done for tax reasons. A business deal should be legal and make sense for sound financial reasons first, and then, of course, have acceptable tax consequences.</li>

			<li>Always consider the potential tax consequences of your clients' matters. If the possible risks or the possible rewards are high, then have competent tax counsel provide their opinion to you and your clients before you recommend and choose any course of action.</li>

			<li>Don't require that a prospective employee already be a trained legal secretary. Be willing to train someone if they have the intelligence, the enthusiasm, and the desire to learn and to work with you. It's worth the additional effort to train staff your way, rather than to retrain someone else's staff.</li>

			<li>To see whether duplicate originals or copies are, in fact, exactly the same, put two of the pages with the same page number together, one on top of the other, and then hold them up to a light source. If they are identical, each letter will overlap perfectly and it will be obvious with just a glance. If they're not identical, be glad you've done your job.</li>

			<li>If some of the words on a copy of a document provided to you are very light, you can enhance their readability by going over them with a highlighter.</li>

			<li>Remember, no matter how honorable and meritorious your efforts may be for your clients, the practice of law is a business, not a charity. Your family expects you to make enough money to maintain, if not improve, their standard of living. Don't disappoint them.</li>

			<li>Getting paid as a trial lawyer is very important because the judge will not release you as trial counsel, either civil or criminal, unless there is substitute counsel to replace you. (And good luck finding substitute counsel when you tell them you're not getting paid.)</li>

			<li>A living person has no heirs.</li>

			<li>Adverse possession: OCEAN
				Open,
				Continuous,
				Exclusive,
				Adverse, and
				Notorious.
