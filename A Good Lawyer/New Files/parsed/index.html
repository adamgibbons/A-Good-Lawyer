<p><b>Foreword</b></p>
<p><b>W</b>hen  a  book  is  republished,  the  author, assuming  still  alive  and  thoughtful,  faces  the question:  Should anything be changed?  It is not an  easy  question  to  answer.    It  is  a  particularly difficult one for lawyers because we have trained ourselves to change things for the better, but we also know we can’t rewrite forever.  It’s a mistake to gild the lily, but not every flower is a lily. </p>
<p>Harvard Law School Professor Roscoe Pound published his law student primer  <i>An Introduction</i> <i>to  the  Philosophy  of  Law </i> based  upon  the  Storrs Lectures he delivered to law students at the Law School  of  Yale  University  in  1921-22.    In  his preface to his Revised Edition published in 1953, when he was then a Professor at the University of California at Los Angeles Law School, Professor Pound wrote:</p>
<p>Problems  of  philosophy  have  arisen  in the  generation  since  the  first  edition xi</p>
<p/>
<p>xii</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>which have required rethinking of some of the things I said in 1921-22.  Likewise discussions and  recent theories of legal liability and some features of the law of property  and  of  the  law  of  contract, which have been developed throughout the world in recent decades, have called not only for rewriting of no little but also for considerable additions to the original text. </p>
<p>Columbia University  Law School  Professor Karl  Llewellyn  took  a  different  tack  on  the question  of  rewriting  and  concluded  in  his Foreword  to  the  1950  reprinting  of  his  original 1930  primer  for  law  students  on  the  essence  of learning the law,  <i>Bramble Bush: On Our Law and</i> <i>Its Study</i>:</p>
<p>As  indicated  already,  and  as  is developed  in  the  Afterword,  this  is  not the book that I should write today.  I feel a  lack  especially  in  the  failure  to  get before the reader at the outset the idea of the crafts of the law, of their value to the Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>xiii</p>
<p>prospective  craftsman,  and  of  his obligation to those crafts.  But there is at least  this  to  be  said  in  mitigation:  the first craft of the law a man must learn is the craft  of  the law  student;  and  to  that one  the  lectures  as  written  attempt  to give both body and meaning. </p>
<p>These good lawyers’ guideposts grew out of my desire in the early 1990’s to collect some of the  lawyering  lessons  I  had  learned  over  two decades  of  lawyering  and  to  share  them  with others.  I began by using them as outlines for my c o n tin u in g  </p>
<p>le g a l </p>
<p>e d u c a tio n  e thic s </p>
<p>a n d</p>
<p>professionalism  lectures  to  lawyers  around  the country.    By  publishing  them  in  book  form  in 1997  I  had  initially  hoped  that  these  good lawyers’  secrets  would  also  “be  used  in  law schools to give law students some guideposts for practicing  law  honorably  and  some  compass points for ethics,” and I wrote exactly that in the book’s Introduction. </p>
<p>Although received by the practicing bar with reasonable  favor,  these  guideposts  have  not  to xiv</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>date, to my knowledge, been regularly used in any law school curriculum.  In fact, a few years after publishing  them  and  having  received  some commendable reviews in the professional press, I sent  two  books  to  each  of  about  15  law  school deans  inviting  them  to  keep  one  copy  as  a  gift from  me  for  their  library  and  to  pass  the  other copy  on  to  their  appropriate  academic  decision makers to consider including it somewhere in their law school’s curriculum.  All but one of those law school deans never responded at all.  The single response letter said simply: “There is no place in a law school curriculum for this book.” For  more  than  ten  years  now  I  have  been planning  and  revising  a  rewrite  of  my  original secrets, and stewing in my own juice over the law school community’s apparent universal rejection of  my  precious  guideposts.    But  now  that  the opportunity  has actually  arrived  for  me  to  make those major revisions, and perhaps include enough changes to entice law school professors and their law  school  curriculum  coordinators,  I  have reconsidered and concluded that I have no reason to rewrite.  I find myself more in agreement with Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>xv</p>
<p>Professor  Llewellyn  than  with  Professor  Pound. </p>
<p>The  seasoned  practicing  trial  lawyer  and entrepreneurial  small  businessman  who  was simultaneously trying cases, running his law firm, and writing and rewriting these secrets in the mid-1990’s  knew  what  he  was  writing  about.    He doesn’t need nor deserve me rewriting his diary. </p>
<p>So I republish his and my good lawyers’ secrets with  only  modest  changes  as  I  would  normally correct page proofs. </p>
<p>As  to  whether  this  primer  for  good  lawyers should  be  requisite  material  for  law  students  to learn, I’m not so certain anymore.  Perhaps that’s another  indication  of  my  different  perspective now than when I was in the heat of the battles and first writing them.  Perchance those discourteous law school deans who were the recipients of my unsolicited  donations  and  inquiries  backed  into getting it right. I can accept that so long as their curriculum  includes  Professor  Pound  and Professor Llewellyn’s law student primers. </p>
<p>If   <i>Bram ble  Bush  </i> is  best  read,  reread,  and learned  by  law  school  students  throughout  their law  school  years,  for  example,  then   <i>A  Good</i> xvi</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p> <i>Lawyer  </i> may  likewise  be  best  read,  reread,  and considered by practicing lawyers wanting to learn those  crafts  of  the  law,  their  value  to  those prospective  craftsmen,  and  their  obligations  to those crafts that Professor Llewellyn regretted was missing from his law student primer.  It would be my  greatest  legal  legacy  if,  as  Professor  Pound and Professor Llewellyn’s little books are among the  books  that  all  good  law  students  have at  the ready, my little book is among the books that all good lawyers have at the ready. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><b>M</b>y  goal  in  writing   <i>A  Good  Lawyer  </i> was  to create a small book to be for all who practice law what Strunk and W hite's  <i>The Elements of Style </i> is for all who write.  A book by a lawyer for lawyers on the essence of lawyering.  A book to be used by  lawyers  to  help  fill  in  the  gaps  that  we  don't currently teach or learn in law school, or find in the  rules  of  evidence  or  procedure,  but  that  we need  to  know  to  practice  law  and  to  do  it honorably.    I  hope  it  also  will  be  used  in  law schools to give law students some guideposts for practicing  law  honorably  and  some  compass points for ethics. </p>
<p>There are approximately 800,000 practicing lawyers in the United States today.  Over 50,000</p>
<p>men and women enter law school each year and more than 40,000 become new lawyers each year. </p>
<p>This  book  says  as  succinctly  as  I  could  what  I believe  is  rightfully  expected  of  a  good  lawyer and  hopefully  it  will  be  read,  considered  and talked about by lawyers and law students. </p>

<p>I've  tried  here  to  speak  to  and  about  lawyers  in Summer, 1997</p>
<p>useful practical terms that all who read it, whether or  not  they  are  lawyers,  can  understand  and immediately use either to reinforce or reconsider their  own  beliefs  or  to  discuss  with  their  own lawyers. </p>
<p>The reader I always had in mind as I wrote it was  a  lawyer,  of  course,  but  looking  over  that lawyer's  shoulder  and  also  reading  it  was  that lawyer's  client.    I  hope  it  generates  discussions between and among lawyers and our clients about what we should expect from each other. </p>
<p>Finally, I have included a complete copy of The Constitution of the United States of America as an Appendix.  It's our Constitution that makes America so different from everywhere else in our world and every American should remember that it's our American lawyers who guarantee that our Constitutional rights of the citizens and <b>I.

<p><b>T</b>he art of lawyering is not a science, it's not limited  to  licensed  attorneys,  nor  is  it  subject  to universal agreement.  I began lawyering as a boot M arine  Corps  Second  Lieutenant  just  graduated from  The  Basic  School  and  the  U.S.  Naval Academy.   It wasn't until a few years later that I actually graduated from The American University W ashington College of Law, passed the bar exams and was licensed to practice law in Virginia and M aryland and waived into the bar of the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>M any of my Annapolis Navy and M arine contemporaries  eventually  left  the  service  and became  airline  pilots.    W hether  in  or  out  of  the service,  over  the  years  they  have  trained  for thousands  of  hours  so  that  they  will  react appropriately  and  calmly  in  the  few  seconds  of crisis that may occur in their aviation careers.  At 1</p>

<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>the  other  extreme,  lawyers  have  no  training  in crisis  management,  yet  that's<b>  </b>part  of  our  legal practice almost every day. </p>
<p>W ho  are  we  lawyers?    Our  families, friends,  neighbors  and,  most  amazingly,  total strangers, turn to us with their most personal and consequential  matters  and  we  all,  both  they  and us, are confident we can assist them.  And, if we're good  lawyers,  we  do  assist  them.    W e  manage crises.  W e work the problems.  W e do the deals. </p>
<p>W e try the cases.  W e serve our clients. </p>
<p>One navigation instructor's first words to my  class  years  ago  were:  “You  can  pass  this course  by  scoring  80  percent,  but  how  many  of you  only  want  to  make  it  home  four  out  of  five times?”  In client representation, as in navigation, perfection is the only acceptable goal.  The good lawyers’ secrets are guideposts that provide some of  the  lawyering  navigational  aids  to  help  us always find the <i> </i> harbor lights of home. </p>
<p>Shakespeare  wrote:  “All  the  world’s  a stage,  and  all  the  men  and  women  merely players.”  W hen we're away from our homes, who lives  in  our  lawyers'  world  with  us?    W ho  are Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>these players we share our stage with?  Secretaries and  staff,  clients,  opposing  counsel,  opposing counsel's  clients,  judges,  clerks,  court  reporters, media  reporters  and  journalists,  the  list  is seemingly endless.  M any of these players are not interested in assisting us and some are downright opposed  to  us  accomplishing  our  goals  for  our clients.   Yet we need to accomplish our mission and  to  make  it  home  safely.    Our  opponents are trying to do the same.  In the transactional arenas we  perform  in,  it  is  easier  for  both  of  us  to  be successful.    In  the  adversarial  forums,  it's considerably harder. </p>
<p>W hat  are  each  of  these  player's expectations of us and how can we meet theirs as well  as  our  own  expectations  and  aspirations? </p>
<p>How can we treat each of them as we want to be treated?    How  can  we  balance  their  competing demands on us and remain true to ourselves and to our clients?   In the heat of the lawyering  battles we  need  unwavering  principles  to  guide  us steadfastly.  In the throes of the storms we need lighthouses and buoys to ensure we steer clear of dangers  and  distractions  as  we  complete  our 4</p>

<p>Lawyers are the custodians of the ideals of our society. </p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>Honor,  courage,  and  commitment  are  the heart  and  the  soul  and  the  body  of  a lawyer. </p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>Lawyering is an art, not a science.  It takes study,  observation  and  experience  to master the art of lawyering. </p>
<p>4. </p>
<p>Lawyering  is  difficult.    It  requires continuous  thinking–one of  the things  we all find hardest to do. </p>
<p>5. </p>
<p>Lawyering  requires  working  hard,  but  it's not hard work.  Thinking is hard, but it's not hard work either.  I can't define hard work Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>for you, but I know it when I see it.  Long hours alone don't define hard work.  People who  do  hard  work  for  a  living  understand this.  You should, too. </p>
<p>6. </p>
<p>Trust  your  instincts,  especially  when interviewing prospective clients. </p>
<p>7. </p>
<p>Try  not  to  waste  too  much  time  thinking about  why  the  other  side  did  or  didn't  do something. </p>
<p>8. </p>
<p>Be  thankful  for  those  who  declare  their opposition  to  you,  they  are  much  easier  to deal  with  than  those  who  masquerade  as allies. </p>
<p>9. </p>
<p>In the practice of law you have no friends, only  opponents  and  potential  opponents. </p>
<p>Forewarned is forearmed. </p>
<p>10. </p>
<p>Listen  to  those  who  disagree  with  you.    It takes courage to confront you, so they may really have a point worth listening to. </p>

<p>Few counsel can successfully  <i>use</i> the media. </p>

<p>12. </p>
<p>Find  out  as  soon  as  possible  whether  the person  you  are  dealing  with  has  the authority to do, or to agree to, what you're proposing.    Don't  let  others  take  your message  or  your  offer  to  their  decision maker.  Demand to present it yourself. </p>
<p>13. </p>
<p>Trial lawyers have a hard time delegating<b>. </b></p>
<p>14. </p>
<p>Be known as the lawyer who makes deals, not breaks them. </p>
<p>15. </p>
<p>Create and propose legitimate, sound alternatives to get your client the desired result. </p>
<p>Think  of  ways  to  accomplish  things,  not reasons  why  they  won't  work  or  can't  be done.  Be a  <i>closer</i>. </p>
<p>16. </p>
<p>Be known for your good business, as well as good  legal  judgment.    They  often  are irretrievably intertwined. </p>

<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>

<p>17. </p>
<p>If  you  listen  to  what  your  opponent  says, read  what  your  opponent  writes, and  think about what you've heard and read, then most of  the  time  you'll  know  what  to  anticipate and you can plan accordingly. </p>
<p>18. </p>
<p>Always  ask  yourself:    Is  this  something  I can, and should, do for my client, or would my  client  be  better  served  if  someone  else did it?  Ask yourself this question not only with respect to others on your staff, whose fees would be less expensive than yours, but also  as  to  lawyers  outside  your  law  firm, who may specialize in that legal area. </p>
<p>19. </p>
<p>If  your  goal  is  to  persuade  someone  to  do something  that  you  want  them  to  do,  then don't be overly concerned with  <i>why</i> they do it <i>, </i> if they <i> do </i> what you want them to do <i>. </i></p>
<p>20 <i>. </i></p>
<p>Know the preeminent practicing lawyers in the various legal specialties in your local bar well enough so that you can call them, not only to refer cases to them, or to bring them 8</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>in as specialists in matters you are handling, but also to see whether they agree that you can  handle  it,  when  you  are  considering taking on a new case in their specialty area of practice.  If they know you, then they will usually  give  you  their  candid  opinions.  If you do decide to take on the case, they will oftentimes  offer  to  be  available  for  you  to call when unusual things happen along the way. </p>
<p>21. </p>
<p>Don't ask judges for advice, in or out of the courtroom. </p>
<p>22. </p>
<p>The  lawyer  has  to  be  the  detail  person. </p>
<p>Check and recheck everything. </p>
<p>23. </p>
<p>It  is  important  that  everyone  that  you  deal with have universal faith in the accuracy of what you say and give to them. </p>
<p>24. </p>
<p>You are the messenger, not the message. </p>

<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>

<p>25. </p>
<p>Thank fellow lawyers who refer cases to you by  taking  them  to  breakfast  or  lunch.    Do not volunteer that you will keep them posted on how the case is going.  You have enough things  to  worry  about,  don't  unnecessarily create more. </p>
<p>26. </p>
<p>Don't create your own troubles.  Leave that to your opponents. </p>
<p>27. </p>
<p>Be proud of what you do and what you have done  for  each  of  your  clients.    It  is  your life's  work  and  your  personal  and professional legacy, not only to your family, but  to  those  who  follow  you  to  strive  to master the art of lawyering. </p>
<p>28. </p>
<p>Know who your client is. </p>
<p>29. </p>
<p>Remember who your client is. </p>
<p>30. </p>
<p>Only represent your client. </p>
<p>31. </p>
<p>Don't surprise your client. </p>
<p/>
<p>10</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>32. </p>
<p>After  each  prospective  client  has  told  you their  story,  but  before  you  tell  them  what you  think,  ask  them  what  they  want  and why.    Their  responses  may  surprise  you. </p>
<p>After  you've  found  out  what <i>  they  </i> really want <i>, </i> then  tell  them  honestly  and  realistically whether you can help them get it. </p>
<p>33. </p>
<p>W hen  a  new  client  leaves  your  office they should  stop  worrying  about  their  problem. </p>
<p>You should tell them that they need to move on  with  their  lives,  to  take  care  of  their family and their<b> </b>business, and it is now your job  to  worry  this  case.    This  may  be  the most therapeutic thing you can do for your clients and the one thing each will remember and appreciate the most, forever. </p>
<p>34. </p>
<p>Question your client only at a time and in a place  where  the  answers  will  remain attorney/client-privileged information. </p>

<p>If you batted .333 for a baseball career you'd be enshrined at Cooperstown, New York, in Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>the  Baseball  Hall  of  Fame. <b>  </b>Clients  know home runs, extra base hits, even singles are hard to get.  But if they believe that they had their  day  in  court,  and  that  you  gave  them three honorable and legitimate swings, with all your best efforts, they'll be satisfied that you  served  them  well,  and  you  will  have, regardless of the outcome. </p>
<p>36. </p>
<p>Don't expect thank you's or kudos from your clients.  But savor them when they come. </p>
<p>37. </p>
<p>If  you  give  your  clients  your  home  phone number, then expect they'll call you at home. </p>
<p>38. </p>
<p>No  one  but  you  should  provide  any information at any time to anybody.  Train your staff from the outset that their job is to take  in  information  and  to  write  down questions  to  pass  on  to  you,  but  that  only you provide any information or answer any questions.    There  are<b>  </b>no  gray  areas  here. </p>
<p>This is true, regardless of whether the caller is  a  client  or  opposing  counsel.    Even  a 12</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>frustrated client, once you have explained it to  them,  should  appreciate  your  diligence and absolute adherence to the attorney/client privilege. </p>
<p>39. </p>
<p>Don't  represent  both  the  husband  and  the wife in a divorce proceeding, no matter how much they argue for it, nor how simple and straightforward  the  process  may  seem. </p>
<p>Choose one or the other, and ensure that all documents reflect that spouse as your only client, especially if the other spouse chooses to represent themselves. </p>
<p>40. </p>
<p>Be very wary of the prospective client who is  currently  represented  by  counsel,  but shopping  around  for  replacement  counsel, unbeknownst to their present counsel. </p>
<p>41. </p>
<p>Always  be  alert  for  potential  conflicts  of interest.  M ake a preliminary conflict check as  soon  as  you  know  the  name  of  the prospective  client  and  the  general  subject matter  of  the  representation.    Resolve  all Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>potential conflicts issues before<b> </b>undertaking any representation. </p>
<p>42. </p>
<p>It's the recognition of the potential conflict of  interest  that's  the  hard  part.    Once identified as a potential conflict of interest, it's  usually  a  straightforward  exercise  to determine whether or not there is a conflict. </p>
<p>43. </p>
<p>Be  familiar  with  the  names  and  telephone numbers of the people who run the Federal, State,  and  local  government  services, agencies,  and  programs,  as  well  as  the private and not-for-profit organizations, so that  you  can  recommend  them  to prospective clients who may have no legal remedy  but  who  have  definite  needs  for assistance.  Make the initial call for them. </p>
<p>44. </p>
<p>Lawyering does not require or condone any distraction  from  your  own  high  moral  and ethical standards.  Be true to yourself and to those standards, always. </p>
<p/>

<p>45. </p>
<p>As a trial lawyer at trial you are a hired gun. </p>
<p>If  you  try  to  be  something  more  than  that, you will be something less. </p>
<p>46. </p>
<p>The  trial  lawyer  at  trial  is  a  one-armed paperhanger,  a  multi-instrumented  street musician  and  singer,  and  a  one-person movie industry:  producer, director, writer, set designer, stagehand, and star performer. </p>
<p>Break a leg. </p>
<p>47. </p>
<p>The  court  clerk,  court  reporter,  and courtroom marshall are your best indicators of  how  you  are  doing  at  trial.  Ask  them. </p>
<p>Listen to what they say. </p>
<p>48. </p>
<p>Don't  tell  the jury  that  what  you  say  is not evidence  for  them  to  consider.    Persuade them by everything you do and say that what <i>you</i> say are the most important words they will hear. </p>
<p>49. </p>
<p>Treat the judge as the first among equals. </p>
<p/>
<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>50. </p>
<p>Never assume the judge knows anything. </p>
<p>51. </p>
<p>If you can't do it sincerely, don't do it.  Little children  and  juries  recognize,  appreciate, and  reward  sincerity.    Juries  punish insincerity. </p>
<p>52. </p>
<p>W atch  other  trial  lawyers  perform.    Study their  successes and  failures.    Take  as  your own  whatever  you  can  wear  comfortably and  naturally.    But  remember  everything takes  practice  and  few  things  feel comfortable or natural the first time you try them on. </p>
<p>53. </p>
<p>A trial lawyer is not a good follower. </p>
<p>54. </p>
<p>The assistance provided to trial lawyers by tho se  </p>
<p>in </p>
<p>c o u rt  clerks'  o ffices </p>
<p>is</p>
<p>immeasurable and generously given.  But it is not legal advice and provides you no safe harbor should it prove to be erroneous. </p>
<p/>
<p>16</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>55. </p>
<p>Choose and use your local counsel wisely. </p>
<p>They should be invaluable.  M ake sure they are. </p>
<p>56. </p>
<p>Search for and hire the best expert witnesses available  and  then  keep  the  tightest  rein possible  on  each  of  them.    None  of  your experts  should  even  think  about  doing something,  writing  something,  or  saying something,  and  certainly  not  spending  any money,  without  checking  with  you  first  to pre-approve it. </p>
<p>57. </p>
<p>Avoid  familiarity  with  opposing  counsel. </p>
<p>Friendly  is  not  a  term  your  client  should think of when describing your  relationship with  your  opposing  counsel.    Civil  and respectful, yes; friendly, no. </p>
<p>58. </p>
<p>In  court,  argue  to  the  judge  about  your opponent's  arguments,  not  about  your opponent. Judges abhor bickering between counsel. </p>
<p/>
<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>59. </p>
<p>Imagine a coin  balanced on its edge in the center  of  a  circle,  heads  facing  north  and tails  facing  south.    As  the  trial  lawyer  you are stationed at one of the poles of the circle and  your  opponent  is at  the  other.    During the  trial,  the  jury  is  walking  around  the circle  hearing,  alternatively,  you  and  then your  opponent,  describe  opposite  sides  of that  same  coin.    Each  of  you  is  arguing accurately  what  you  want  the  jury  to  see inside that circle.  At the conclusion of the trial the jury will tell you which of you was more persuasive, not what's inside the circle. </p>
<p>60. </p>
<p>In those jurisdictions where jury instructions precede  closing  arguments,  the  lawyer giving  the <i>  final  </i> closing  argument  has  an advantage over their opponent, because the jury stops walking around the circle facing that  lawyer's  side  of  the  coin,  and  then retires to deliberate. </p>
<p/>
<p>18</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>61. </p>
<p>As the trial lawyer you should be the jury's teacher  and  you  should  use  teaching techniques:</p>
<p>1. </p>
<p>Tell  them  what's  going  to  happen (opening statement); </p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>M ake  it  happen  (direct  and  cross examination of witnesses; admission of evidence); and, </p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>Tell  them  what  happened  (closing argument). </p>
<p>62. </p>
<p>W hen  your  opponent  concentrates  on  the personalities  involved  (including  yours), rather  than  on  the  facts,  the  issues  and  the law, it usually means that they think you're holding  the  winning  cards  and  that distracting you is their best strategy.  Don't fall for it.  Stay on your course and win. </p>
<p/>
<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>63. </p>
<p>At trial, the more lawyers there are sitting at opposing counsel's table, the better off you are. </p>
<p>64. </p>
<p>You don't learn any more about trying cases sitting  in  the   <i>second</i>   <i>chair</i>,  than  you  learn about  driving  cars  sitting  in  the  passenger seat. </p>
<p>65. </p>
<p>A trial lawyer must have the same intensity, ability  to  focus,  and  unwavering  absolute self-confidence  in  themselves,  their preparation  for  this  moment,  and  the certainty of their eventual victory as an ace combat  pilot  in  a  single-engine  jet  fighter outnumbered in an aerial dogfight. </p>
<p/>
<p>20</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>66. </p>
<p>Each  individual  has  their  own  personal dignity, just as they have their own personal shadow,  that  varies  with  the  amount  and angle  of  light  shining  on  that  person.    Our democratic  society,  and  our justice system within our democracy, will only last as long as we continue to recognize that that dignity, even of the weakest or the vilest amongst us, requires our equal treatment of every one of us  under  our  laws.    This  is  the  lawyer's gospel.  Be prepared to fight and to die for it. </p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center">*  *  *</p>

<p><b>II.  The Tools</b></p>
<p>While I have aggregated these good lawyers’</p>
<p>secrets into various chapters in an attempt to give the reader a way of looking at each of them as part of a greater whole, this letterboxing approach is no more reasonable, or unreasonable, than dividing the law  itself  into  separate  and  distinct  law  school courses.    There  are  many  ways,  of  course,  to subdivide  these  secrets,  or  to  subdivide  the  law itself  for  that  matter.    I've  chosen  one  approach here; another might seem more reasonable to you. </p>
<p>As  with  the  law  itself,  I  hope  the  form  selected won't distract but will enhance their substance. </p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln once wrote, and it’s still true  today,  not  only  for  good  lawyers,  but  for  all who seek success: “The leading rule for the lawyer, as for the man of every other calling, is diligence.” 21</p>

<p>lawyers force ourselves to serve all our clients, the sooner  all  our  clients  will  be  receptive  to entertaining real discussions on the factual, legal, and  ethical  constraints  involved  with  lawyering. </p>
<p>Right now most just don’t care. </p>
<p>This book will serve a useful purpose to the legal  profession  and  to  the  public  if  it  helps  to continue  the  discussions  between  and  among lawyers and their clients concerning defining good counsel  and  if  those  discussions  reinforce  the bridge  of  trust  and  understanding  between  all clients, not just the best ones, and all their lawyers, not just the good ones. </p><p>

<p>Quiet  contemplation  is  not  a  luxury,  but  a necessity, for a lawyer. </p>

<p>You are an artist.  Be creative. </p>
<p/>
<p>24</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>Use  legal  words  and  phrases  for  accuracy only  and  not  for  obscuration.    Explain  the legal terms in layman's terms to make sure your client understands what you're saying. </p>
<p>4. </p>
<p>Read everything you can.  Ideas will come to you while you are reading. </p>
<p>5. </p>
<p>W hen you think of something or get an idea write  it  down  as  soon  as  possible,  in  a stream  of  consciousness  manner,  and  as much  of  it  as  possible.    Once  you  have  it written down, then you can start rethinking it, revising it, or critically taking it apart. </p>
<p>6. </p>
<p>T ake  notes  whenever  someone  else  is providing information, e.g., telephone calls, interviews, depositions, witness  testimony. </p>
<p>Draw  a  vertical  line  from  top  to  bottom dividing each page:  two thirds of the page to  the  left  and  one  third  to  the  right  of the line.  W rite on every other line.  W rite fast Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>25</p>

<p>Tab,  underline,  highlight,  and  write  in  the margins  of  your  legal  texts  and  books, including  this  one.    Personalize  them  with your  cases,  your  comments,  and  your memories.  It's part of your legacy. </p>

<p>Your  reputation  wins  clients.    Your performance  wins  trials.    As  with  a professional  golfer,  it's  only  how  you perform that matters.  No one wins a trial, or a golf tournament, on reputation. </p>

<p>Your  reputation  is  like  your  passport.    It's critical  that  it  be  accurate  and  up  to  date. </p>
<p>But once it gets you in the door it serves no further purpose.  It's only what you do once you're there that counts. </p>

<p>Good judgment is learned and honed every day.  It  has  little  to  do  with  your  genes, your  wealth,  or  your  status  in  your community.    It  has  everything  to  do  with what you've learned from what you've done and from what you've seen.  Pray for good judgment.    It's  the  lifeblood  of  good counsel. </p>

<p>Don't complain and don't whine.  Propose constructive  alternatives  and  argue  for their adoption. </p>

<p>Avoid using the fax machine for sensitive material.  If you must use it for expediency purposes  and  your  document  contains attorney/client-privileged  information  or anything  you'd  prefer  not  to  see  on  the front page of tomorrow’s newspapers, then first  double-check  the  telephone  number with the prospective recipient and then fax it yourself. </p>
<p/>

<p>14. </p>
<p>If  you  are  dealing  with  sensitive  matters, consider  whether  or  not  any  document, whether paper or electronic, really needs to be  created.  Consider  oral  briefings  in person, with the client taking no notes. </p>
<p>15. </p>
<p>Expect  that  anything  entered  into  any electronic word processing system will be retrievable by your opponents. </p>
<p>16. </p>
<p>Understand and be able to use by yourself, if necessary, every single thing in your law offices,  e.g.,  word-processing  programs, computer  systems,  telecommunications, networks,  postage  meter  and  scale,  fax machines.  Don't be absolutely dependent upon anyone other than yourself. </p>
<p>l7. </p>
<p>Don't wait for things to happen.  As soon as you've accepted a case, make a plan and then  begin  executing  that  plan.    Massage and retool it as the case progresses to and through completion. </p>

<p>All  documents  that  you  prepare  for legislators and their staff should be written so  that  they  can  be  inserted,  as  is,  in  the member's  statements  and  speeches, legislative and committee reports, as well as  the  legislation  itself.    Do  the  staff  and the  member's  work  for  them.    Don't  give them your requests as to what they should do, say, or write; write it yourself precisely the  way  you  want  it  written  or  said  and give it to them. </p>
<p>21. </p>
<p>If  everyone  involved  with  the  legislative process knows that what you give them is always  accurate,  then  you  stand  the  best chance of anyone of having your materials selected  and  your  position  accepted,  if that's the direction the legislators decide to go. </p>

<p>Before  beginning   <i>any  </i> work,  make  sure your  client  understands  and  agrees  with your  fee  arrangement  and  billing procedures. </p>
<p/>
<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>28. </p>
<p>Have  a  simple,  straightforward,  and  one-page  "Client  Information  Sheet"  that  the prospective  client  can  complete  before meeting  with  you  for  the  first  time.    This should provide you with basic information about the client, their spouse and children, if any,  employment  and  Social  Security Number.    It  should  not  ask  for  any information concerning the subject matter of the prospective legal representation. </p>
<p>29. </p>
<p>Use  a  tailored  "Legal  Representation  and Fee  Agreement  Letter"  for  each  client  and for each matter.  Spell out in that letter from you  to  your  client,  at  least:  what  the  legal matter is; what the fee arrangement is; how often you will bill; what your expectations and  the  client's  agreements  are  concerning timing  of  payments  of  your  bills;  any retainer  provisions,  including  interest  on retainers  and  replenishment  of  retainers; whether  your  legal  representation  includes the  filing  of  a  lawsuit  and  trial 34</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>representation; if so, whether it includes the appeal  of  any  trial  court  rulings  or  orders; and, finally, the fact that you have made no promises of success to your client.  Explain that costs are not included in legal fees, and that under all circumstances, the client will be responsible for all costs. Emphasize that you  will  keep  costs  to  a <i>  </i> minimum.

<p>AGREED"  and date their signature. Keep the original in your file and give your client a <i> </i> copy of the signed letter agreement. </p>
<p>30. </p>
<p>Keep  the  originals  of  the  signed  Legal Representation  and  Fee  Agreement  Letter and the completed Client Information Sheet together and in the same place in every case file. </p>
<p/>
<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>31. </p>
<p>As  a  final  check,  before  you  authorize anything  that  will  be  passed  on  to  your client as a cost, imagine that your roles are reversed and that you are now the client: Do you  want  your  money  spent  this  way?    If you do, then go ahead.  If you have to think about it, then you probably don’t. </p>
<p>32. </p>
<p>W hen  counseling  prospective  clients  who have had their employment terminated and are questioning whether they have any legal remedies  against  their  former  employer, remember that the loss of their job follows only  the  loss  of  a <i>  </i> loved  one,  or  a catastro phic  physical  injury,  in  its devastating effect on a person.  Do all that you  can  to  preserve,  or  rejuvenate,  that person's  self-esteem  and  self-confidence. </p>
<p>They should be encouraged to see what has happened to them as an opportunity to move forward, albeit in another direction, and not to  become  obsessed  with  “righting  this wrong,”  or    “vindicating  their  reputation.” M ost of the time there is no legal cause of 36</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>action  against  the  former  employer,  since most  of us are  employees  at  will,  but your counsel needs to go beyond that and to help that person understand and appreciate their continued  value  to  themselves,  to  their family, and to society, notwithstanding the fact  that  they  don't  currently  have  a  job. </p>
<p>That is only a temporary condition. </p>
<p>33. </p>
<p>A  lawyer  must  constantly  monitor  the appropriate proximity to maintain with each client  so  that  you  are  balancing  the objectivity  that  distance  provides  with  the subjectivity  that  closeness  provides.    That distance  is  different  for  each  client.    Don't get sucked in. </p>
<p>34. </p>
<p>You  do  your  client  a  disservice  if  you cannot maintain your objectivity about their case.    Be  passionately  objective,  if  you must, but be objective. </p>

<p>Create and bring your proposed settlement agreement  to  trial,  and  if  your  opponent offers  to  settle  on  the  courthouse  steps,  or during  trial,  make  any  necessary  pen-and-ink  changes  to  your  settlement  agreement and  then  execute  the  agreement  right  then and  there,  preferably  in  front  of  the  trial judge in chambers. </p>
<p>41. </p>
<p>It ain't over 'til the check's cashed. </p>
<p>42. </p>
<p>Build your own M odel Trial Notebook with tabs  for  each  divisible  portion  of  trial preparation  and  presentation,  e.g.,  legal research,  discovery,  opening,  witnesses, exhibits,  closing,  instructions.    W henever you read something that you agree with, cut it  out  and  put  it  in  your  Model  Trial Notebook.    Then,  read  and  reread  your M odel Trial Notebook. </p>
<p>43. </p>
<p>Keep a separate trial notebook for each case you have, with tabs and sections that mirror your M odel Trial Notebook.  Start it when you open the casefile. </p>

<p>Create  your  jury  instructions  as  soon  as possible.  Keep them in your trial notebook and keep revising them as the case becomes clearer  and  as  your  theory  of  the  case crystallizes. </p>
<p>45. </p>
<p>Object and fight ferociously to keep matters from  the  jury  that  are  detrimental  to  your client  or  to  your  theory  of  the  case. </p>
<p>Otherwise,  even  if  they  are  technically objectionable,  don't  object.    Pick  your fights. </p>
<p>46. </p>
<p>Don't  expect  much  more  in  answers  to written  interrogatories  than  names  and addresses  of  the  people  involved  and descriptions of the documents involved.  No matter  how  artful  your  written  interrogatories are, opposing counsel will usually try  to  find  ways  either  to  object  or  to provide nonresponsive answers.  Therefore, realistically,  the  best  use  of  written  interrogatories  is  to  determine  who  to  depose and what documents to request be produced. </p>

<p>Use  requests  for  admissions  continuously and  exhaustively.    W rite  short,  simple factual  statements  that  provide  no  wriggle room for opposing counsel.  The more you can get your opponent to admit, the less you will have to prove. </p>
<p>48. </p>
<p>If you have any doubt as to whether any of the witnesses might not be at the civil trial, then  take  their   <i>de  benne  esse  </i> deposition prior to trial. </p>
<p>49. </p>

<p>Create a <i> </i>"Trial Exhibit and Trial Testimony Table" for each case and continue to update it  through  trial.    On  the  left  margin separately list all the elements you will need evidence admitted on to prove your theory of the case.  Across the top of that page, list all  your  witnesses.    Draw  horizontal  lines between  each  of  the  elements  you  have  to prove, and draw vertical lines between each of your witnesses.  W rite, in the appropriate boxes in this T able, the testimony expected and the exhibits that will be introduced and authenticated by each of your witnesses.  Be prepared  for  objections  and,  if  possible, have  alternative  witness  testimony  and methods  of  introduction  ready  to  use,  if necessary.    At  trial, and  after  each  witness has  testified  appropriately  and  after  each exhibit  has  been  admitted,  draw  a  line through  that  statement  or  exhibit.    Stay  in 42</p>

<p>Remember,  on  direct  examination  at  trial since  you  usually  can't  ask  leading questions, it's the witness's  <i>answers </i> that are important, not your  <i>questions</i>.  So a list of the <i>  testimony</i>  needed  from  each  of  your witnesses, found for example  in your Trial Exhibit and Trial Testimony Table, is much more helpful for you to have and use during trial, than a list of the  <i>questions </i> to ask your witnesses. </p>

<p><b>III.  The Venues</b></p>
<p>In l903, the well-known New York trial lawyer, Francis  L.  W ellman,  first  published  his  now-legendary and undisputed classic,  <i>The Art of Cross-Examination</i>.  Borrowing from the original preface to that legal masterpiece, I, too, suggest that I am more a messenger than a creator: In  offering  this  book  to  the  legal profession, I do not intend to arrogate to myself any superior knowledge upon the subject, excepting in so far as it may have been gleaned from actual experience. Nor have I attempted to treat the subject in any scientific,  elaborate,  or  exhaustive  way; but  merely  to  make  some  suggestions upon  the  art  of  [lawyering],  which  have been  gathered  as  a  result  of  twenty-five years [of lawyering] during which time I 47</p>
<p/>
<p>48</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>have [represented clients] drawn from all classes of the community. </p>
<p>If  what  is  here  written  affords anything  of  instruction  to  the  younger members of my profession, or of interest and  entertainment  to  the  public,  it  will amply  justify  the  time  taken  from  my summer vacation to put in readable form some points from my experience upon this most difficult subject. </p>
<p>It is sometimes said that, when discussing lawyering,  one  must  make  a  distinction  between those involved in a private-type practice and those involved  in  a  corporate  environment;  and  that  is often the case.  However, I have not here tried to cut  so  fine  a  slice.    If  some  of  the  good  lawyer's secrets and guideposts herein do not apply to you or to your practice, then just read on.   If you're a practicing  lawyer,  you'll  be  back  on  the orienteering course in a few moments. </p>
<p>Good  lawyers  recognize  other  good lawyers.  They can be found in every jurisdiction, in  every  courthouse,  and  in  every  law  firm  in  the Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>country.  But how can clients find one?  How does a client spot and cut a good lawyer from the rest of the herd?  Apparently Ralph W aldo Emerson must have  needed  a  good  lawyer  one  time,  too.    His thoughtful  advice  to  other  prospective  clients,  in <i>The  Conduct  of  Life</i>,  is  worth  considering:  “The good lawyer is not the man who  .  .  .  qualifies all his qualifications, but who throws himself on your part so heartily that he can get you out of a scrape.” Good lawyers will do that for their clients. Every time.  Everywhere. </p><p>

<p/>

<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>5. </p>
<p>Sometimes the best thing you can do  for  a prospective client is to listen to their story. </p>
<p>T here  are  not  always  legal  remedies  for every wrong.  Sometimes people just need your  concurrence  that  they  have  been wronged  and  your  encouragement  to  press on.    Even  for  that  person,  you  still  have performed a valuable service, because now they truly can move on with their lives and not  forever  be  upset  with  themselves  for failing to file a lawsuit, misbelieving that it would have had some possibility of success. </p>
<p>6. </p>
<p>If you think your prospective client has the facts to change the law in your jurisdiction on  some  point,  before  you  suggest  that course of action, carefully consider whether your client, and you, have the wherewithal and  the  determination  to  see  the  case through  to  its  trial  and  appellate  courts' </p>
<p>completion.    It  may be  better  to  bring  in  a legal gadfly organization at the outset, or to not accept the case at all, than to begin and Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>then later find out, for whatever reason, that you're not able to complete the mission. </p>
<p>7. </p>
<p>Have faith in the legal system, but remember it's a hands-on operation, and the best results occur when your hands are controlling it. </p>
<p>8. </p>
<p>Each  law  firm,  from  the  smallest  to  the largest, has a tone or a morality to it that is consciously  set  by  those  in  power  at  that firm. That firm's moral tone is usually well-known  within  its  own  local  legal community.    It  remains  constant,  because attorneys  comfortable  with  that  morality seek  employment  at  that  firm  and  those uncomfortable with it either avoid working there,  or  leave  once  they  recognize  their incompatibility with it. </p>
<p>9. </p>
<p>W hen  leaving  the  private  practice  of  law, investigate  the  costs  of  purchasing  from your  malpractice  insurer  the   <i>tail</i>  to  your policy.  It's  usually  cost  efficient  and provides protection for claims based on past 52</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>legal representations.  Do everyone a favor and stay covered. </p>
<p>10. </p>
<p>The  practice  of  law  is  a  calling,  it  is  not  a job.    If  it  becomes  just  a  job,  consider refocusing  your  practice  areas  to  reinspire yourself. </p>
<p>11. </p>
<p>Don't become such a specialist that you have truly  put  all  of  your  eggs  in  one  basket. </p>
<p>Develop and maintain several areas of legal expertise  so  that  no  changes  in  statute, caselaw,  or  the  economy  can  make  you obsolete.  Likewise, don’t depend upon one client for too much of your firm’s income. </p>
<p>12. </p>
<p>Lobbying requires more objectivity in your oral  presentations  and  in  your  advocacy documents than does trial lawyering because the legislative process does not provide an opposing advocate who is aware of and who can question everything you say or write as the judicial process does. </p>
<p/>
<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>13. </p>
<p>Lobbying requires different persuasion and advocacy skills than trial lawyering because the  legislative  process  is different  than  the judicial process.  In the courtroom there are rules  of  procedure,  rules  of  evidence, instructions  to  the  jury,  a  judge  and  a marshal to make sure everyone is following the  rules  and  paying  attention  to  what's happening  along  the  way  with  no distractions.  There is a requirement that a verdict be delivered in a timely fashion; and there  is  a  definite  judicial  appeal  process and  a  final  decision.    Legislators,  on  the other  hand,  are  bound  by  no  rules  of  any real  consequence,  are  not  required  to  pay attention  to  the  issues  at  hand,  are  always distracted because they are always running for office, often vote on a particular piece of legislation  for  reasons  totally  unrelated  to that  legislation,  regularly  ignore  time requirements, and have no legislative appeal process for the members on the losing side once a bill is passed. </p>

<p>As  a  trial  lawyer  you  should  always  try  to settle your case, because by definition your client  can  live  with  a  settlement  they  have agreed to.

<p>24. </p>
<p>The  life  of  a  case  through  its  preparation and  then  presentation  at  trial  is  a  roller coaster ride.  Don't dwell on either the highs or  the  lows  along  the  way.    It's  only  the result that counts. </p>

<p>2. W here you will have the best chance that they will ramble on in their answers to your questions; and, </p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>W here,  if  they  refer  to  a  document  in their  answer,  you  will  be  in  the  best position  to  take  a  brief  recess  in  the deposition to have them get it and then continue  with  the  deposition  as seamlessly as possible. </p>
<p>27. </p>
<p>Do not consider future appearances, either before  the  same  judge  or  against  the  same opposing counsel, in pursuing your zealous representation  of  your  client.    An enlightened  bench  and  bar  will  understand your  obligations to  your  current  client  and respect you for honoring them. </p>
<p>28. </p>
<p>Visit and explore a courtroom unfamiliar to you, before you are called upon to perform in it. Sit in the jury box, the witness  chair, and the judge's chair to see their views and lines  of  sight  and  to  hear  how  well  sound travels to and from them. </p>

<p>Arrive early enough on the first day of a jury trial to claim the counsel table closest to the jury.    Don't  relocate  unless  the  judge requires it. </p>
<p>30. </p>
<p>M ake,  and  document,  sincere  reasonable efforts  to  work  out  all  discovery  issues outside  of  the  courtroom.    But  no  matter how  meritorious  your  complaints  about opposing counsel are, expect that the judge will be unmoved by them. </p>
<p>31. </p>
<p>Punish  opposing  counsel  for  intransigence and  unreasonableness  by  beating  them unmercifully  in  court  on  the  merits  of  the case,  not  by  asking  the  judge  to  sanction them. </p>
<p>32. </p>
<p>At  depositions,  especially  those  taken outside  your  regular  geographical  area  of practice,  do  not  agree  to  “the  usual preliminary  understandings.”    If  opposing counsel  has  something  specific  in  mind, Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>have  them  propose  it  to  you  on  the  record and then either agree to it or don't, also on the record. </p>
<p>33. </p>
<p>Before  any  depositions  are  taken,  know whether  or  not,  in  that  jurisdiction, deposition testimony can be used to support motions for summary judgment. </p>
<p>34. </p>
<p>Either  you,  or  your  local  counsel,  should select  your  court  reporter  for  depositions. </p>
<p>Do  not  let  your  opposing  counsel  select  a court reporter for  <i>your</i> depositions. </p>
<p>35. </p>
<p>Agree  to  the  rates  for  the  court  reporter's services,  e.g.,  original  transcript  and  one copy, additional copies, an electronic version of the transcript, travel costs, etc., before you hire  the  court  reporter.    Have  the  court reporter  send  you  those  rates  in  writing,  so you  can  bring  them  with  you  to  the deposition. Confirm with the court reporter, before  starting  the  deposition,  the  rates agreed to. </p>

<p>If  you  are  ever  going  to  be  late  for  a  court appearance,  and  hopefully  this  will  never occur,  call  the  judge's  chambers  as  soon  as you  realize  it  and  give  them  a  reason  why you  will  be  late  and  an  expected  time  of arrival  at  the  court.    Trial  lawyers  are prepared  and  punctual,  always.  Being  late sends the wrong message to the court, to your client, and to your opponents. </p>
<p>37. </p>
<p>The  last  vestige  remaining  in  our  society today  of  the  feudal  concept  of  one  person having  absolute  dominion  and  control  over their own fiefdom is the trial court judge in their own courtroom. </p>

<p>If you want to be a good trial lawyer, then get into  a  busy  prosecutor's  shop,  or  a  busy public  defender's  shop,  right  out  of  law school  for  a  trial  lawyering  internship.    Be famous at that office for taking on more cases than anyone else, for taking the cases no one else  wants,  and  for  dedicating  yourself  to Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>your cases.  Live at the courthouse every day. </p>
<p>Try as many cases to a jury as possible and as often as possible. </p>

<p>Spend  at  least  as  long  as  it  took  you  to  get through  law  school  and  pass  the  bar  in  this trial  lawyering  internship.    It  will  pay  you dividends for the rest of your life, whether or not you ever try another criminal case again. </p>
<p>And whether or not you ever try a civil case. </p>
<p>You  will  not  only  never  forget  how  to  ride this trial lawyering bicycle, but you will have learned  and  perfected  bicycle  riding  like  a circus performer.  Trials will forever be just another day at the office for you. </p>
<p>40. </p>
<p>Expect  that  at  least  one  of  the  parties  will raise  a  new  issue  at  closing  or  attempt  to revisit a settled issue.  Even so, don't let the deal  fall  apart  at  closing,  unless  it's  your client  that's trying  to  back  out.    If  that's  the case,  then  at  the  earliest  possible  time determine whether or not you really want to continue to represent that client. </p>

<p><b>IV.  The Rules</b></p>
<p>My goals in writing this book were threefold. </p>
<p>First,  I  wanted  to  provide  to  counselors,  whether seasoned or not, some  <i>secrets</i> of good lawyers that are  seemingly  arbitrarily  scattered  around  the lawyering  landscape.    They  seem  obvious  to  me now,  and  known  by  all  good  lawyers,  but  they weren't so obvious to me along the way to today. </p>
<p>They  were  usually  learned  first-hand,  in  the lawyering arena itself.  Some may trigger personal memories in lawyers’ and readers’ minds of their own  experiences  that  have  led  them  to  similar conclusions.    Perhaps  younger  members  of  my profession  can  learn  some  of  them  without  the pain. </p>
<p>Second,  I  wanted  to  provide  to  all  clients help in recognizing good lawyering skills in their own counsel.  From a client's perspective, there is no substitute for good counsel, but unfortunately in 63</p>
<p/>
<p>64</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>the heat of the civil or criminal battle, any advice or  strategy  may  seem  sensible  at  the  time.    Most clients, especially new clients, don’t have a yard-stick to measure their counsel against, or the time or  resources  for  a  second  legal  opinion.    If  all clients, not just the good lawyers’ best clients, are also  aware  of  some  of  these  same  legal  secrets, then all clients can more easily recognize when the counsel they receive is on course and on glidepath and when it is not. </p>
<p>Finally,  I  wanted  to  show  some  of  the tension involved in the lawyer-client dynamic that is not often discussed.  In that very fluid relationship there may not be a real appreciation by one for what's driving the other, or any true understanding of what each can and can't do or will and won't do. </p>
<p>One  definition  of  good  lawyers  might  include: W ith their heads in the clouds and their feet on the ground,  but  in  the  shoes  of  their  clients.    As  you read  the  good  lawyer's  counsel  in  these  pages, think  of  each  of  these  good  lawyer's  secrets  as  a guidepost located somewhere on a continuum from heavenly idealism to pedestrian pragmatism. </p>
<p/>
<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>The client is a reality check for the lawyer and, likewise, the lawyer for the client.  Good lawyers know that the ends alone cannot justify the means. </p>
<p>This  conflict,  only  one  among  many  potential lawyer-client conflicts, often causes tension at the nexus of the lawyer-client relationship.  Hopefully, the awareness of these good lawyer's guideposts by all  clients  will  help  them  and  their  lawyers  to appreciate that tension and use it to strengthen and not weaken the relationship. </p>
<p>Law school professors use what they call the <i>Socratic  Method</i>  to  teach  law  students  the  law. </p>
<p>Students’  questions  are   <i>answered</i>  by  the  law professors with other questions asked back to the students.  This Socratic Method, at its best, forces the  law  students  to  think  themselves  through  to their own questions’ answers.  On the other hand, medical school students use rote memorization to learn  for  themselves  as  much  medical  lore  as  the medical schools then think is known. </p>
<p>W hether  the  schooling  influences  the practice,  or  the  practice  drives  the  schooling  is academic, but for each of these professions, legal and  medical,  the  results,  as  seen  by  the  lawyers’</p>
<p/>
<p>66</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>clients  and  the  physicians’  patients,  are  quite different.  Lawyers spend seemingly endless hours researching,  writing,  theorizing,  strategizing, rewriting,  and  thinking.    Physicians,  on  the other hand,  even  the  most  otherwise  sensible  and cerebral  ones,  often  prescribe  from  the  hip  and diagnose  on  the  run,  as  if  each  patient  were  an emergency room situation.  Yet good physicians do have  one  rule  they  follow  above  all  others.    The same first rule that good lawyers also prescribe to. </p>
<p>It comes from  <i>The Physician’s Oath</i>, first delivered by  Hippocrates,  and  still  sensible  counsel  for  all good physicians and for all good lawyers twenty-four hundred years later:  First do no harm. </p><p>

<p>Don't make idle threats, it undermines your credibility. </p>
<p>5. </p>
<p>Don't embarrass your opponent. </p>
<p>6. </p>
<p>On  a  weekly  basis,  review  all  your  open matters  to  ensure  that  each  one  is  being worked appropriately and that nothing has fallen through the cracks. </p>
<p>7. </p>
<p>Never promise success to your client. </p>
<p>8. </p>
<p>Remember the attorney/client privilege.  Is there  a  “need  to  know?”    Loose  lips  sink ships. </p>
<p>9. </p>
<p>Ignore prospective clients' assurances to you that the prospective defendants: “W ill cave in  as  soon  as  they  know  there  is  a  lawyer involved;”  “W ill  settle  because  they  can't afford  any  bad  publicity;”  “Have  always settled cases like this in the past;” and that the  prospective  clients  have  heard  that similarly situated predecessors “Settled for 68</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>a 'bundle' of money and never even had to file  any  lawsuit.”    Suggest  to  those prospective  clients  that  if  any  of  that  is actually true, then they should be hiring the lawyers  who  accomplished  those  results, and not you. </p>
<p>10. </p>
<p>Ignore  earlier  counsel  freely  given  to prospective  clients  by  other  lawyers  that they  may  have  talked  with  who  have</p>
<p>“confirmed”  that  the  client  does,  in  fact, have a “great case”  or “great facts,” but, for whatever  reason,  those  lawyers  are  unable or  unwilling  to  represent  that  prospective client.  Again, suggest to those prospective clients  that  if  their  case  were  such  a  sure thing  those  same  lawyers  would  have handed  it  off  themselves,  and  not  put  the onus back on the client to find appropriate counsel. </p>
<p>11. </p>
<p>Keep  an  accurate,  detailed,  and  updated accounting of the law firm's trust account(s) such  that  it  could  be  produced  on  a moment's  notice.    Train  yourself  to Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>understand and believe that your continued professional  life  could  depend  on  such  an instantaneous  and  accurate  production  of that accounting. </p>
<p>12. </p>
<p>Ensure that the law firm's checking account never  has  any  client's  money  in  it.    Never commingle  any  client's  funds  with  your own.  Never. Not even for a moment. </p>
<p>13. </p>
<p>If  you  decide  not  to  take  on  a  case  after meeting  with  a  prospective  client,  then either in person or by telephone: 1. </p>
<p>T ell  them  that  you're  not  going  to  be able to represent them; </p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>Tell  them  why  you've  come  to  that conclusion; </p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>Encourage  them  to  meet  with  and  to seek the opinions of other lawyers; and, 4. </p>
<p>Remind  them  of  the  statute(s)  of limitations that may be involved. </p>
<p>Follow  that  conversation  with  a  letter  to them to the same effect.  Include with that 70</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>letter,  as  enclosures,  the  originals  of  all documents the prospective client may have left with you to review.  Also, include as a statement in that letter that you have kept no copies  of  any  documents  except  a  copy  of this  letter.    During  your  conversation,  ask the prospective client if they would prefer to come to your offices and pick up your letter and  their  documents  rather  than  have  you mail  them.    Do  whichever  one  the  prospective client wants. </p>
<p>14. </p>
<p>Understand  that  sometimes  you,  or  your staff, will become the target for abuse from everyone, including your client, for reasons that  have  nothing  to  do  with  you  or  your counsel,  but  just  because  you're  available and they're frustrated. This, too, will pass. </p>
<p>15. </p>
<p>As  each  case  progresses,  share  with  your client  your  decisions  and  your  thought processes concerning the moral and ethical issues presented, in addition to the legal and factual ones. </p>

<p>Don't  let  any  misguided  loyalty  to  your client  undermine  your  loyalty  to  yourself, your  ideals,  your  family,  and  your profession. </p>
<p>17. </p>
<p>Anticipate </p>
<p>your </p>
<p>opponent's </p>
<p>counter-</p>
<p>arguments, but don't unnecessarily address them before they're made. </p>
<p>18. </p>
<p>At  trial,  only  ask  questions  to  which  you know  the  answers.    And  don't  stop  asking until you get those answers. </p>
<p>19. </p>
<p>Don't  accept  nonresponsive  replies  from witnesses  or  deponents.    Keep  asking  the question  until  it  is  answered  or  the  Court makes  you  move  on,  making  an  objection for the record before you do. </p>
<p>20. </p>
<p>Learn when to stop asking questions.  Once you get your answer, move on.  Don't gild the lily. </p>
<p>21. </p>
<p>Do not assume a settlement attitude. </p>

<p>An  Asian  expression  translates:    Talk,  T alk, Fight, Fight.  To me that means once the lawsuit has  been  filed,  and  especially  when  you  are discussing settlement, keep the trial preparation pedal to the metal. </p>

<p>Unless  you  have  something  to  say,  don't  say anything.  Let your opponent, the witness, or the deponent fill the silence.  It will pay off. </p>

<p>There is no need for exaggerated theatrics at depositions. </p>

<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>32. </p>
<p>Don't  be  afraid  to  use Biblical,  literary,  or historical references to make your points to the jury, especially in closing.  Using such stories and references can put your case into a  framework  that  the  jury  is  familiar  with and that they can understand and relate to. </p>
<p>33. </p>
<p>Have  one  calendar  that  has  all  of  your professional  as  well  as  personal  schedules and  obligations  on  it.    Always  bring  that calendar to court with you. </p>
<p>34. </p>
<p>It's hard for trial lawyers to empathize with judges, since most trial lawyers have never been  judges.    B ut  as  former  trial  lawyers, most judges recognize and appreciate good trial counsel and understand the conflicting demands made upon lawyers. </p>
<p>35. </p>
<p>The critical  question is not whether a civil case  of  yours  will  settle,  since  most  civil cases do settle, but:  For what amount will it settle?  The best insurance policy available to  guarantee  that  your  case  will  settle  for Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>your  best  number  is  perfectly  preparing yourself for trial. </p>
<p>36. </p>
<p>There  is  a  difference  between  having  a <i>m otions  practice</i>  and  having  a  real   <i>trial</i> <i>practice</i>.  But  since  most  well-prepared cases  settle,  even  the  best  trial  lawyers sometimes,  therefore,  wind  up  with  a <i>motions practice</i>. </p>
<p>37. </p>
<p>There is a difference between a  <i>litigator</i> and a  <i>trial lawyer</i>.  Be the  <i>trial lawyer</i>. </p>
<p>38. </p>
<p>W hen defending the accused in a homicide case,  your  best  theory  of  the  case,  albeit often  unspoken,  may  be:    The  deceased deserved  to  die  and  my  guy  was  the  right guy for the job. </p>
<p>39. </p>
<p>In  a  criminal  defense  case,  your  potential client, the accused, decides:</p>
<p>1. </p>
<p>W hether to plead guilty or not guilty; 2. </p>
<p>W hether  or  not  to  plea  bargain  and  if so what to accept; </p>
<p/>
<p>76</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>W hether  or  not  to  take  the  stand  and testify; and, </p>
<p>4. </p>
<p>W hether  or  not  to  appeal  any conviction. </p>
<p>All  other  matters  should  be  ultimately decided by you as counsel, e.g.,  <i> </i> strategies, theory  of  the  case,  defense(s)  to  use  or abandon,  objections.    If  your  prospective client is unwilling to agree to this arrangement,  strongly  consider  not  beginning  the relationship. </p>
<p>40. </p>
<p>As  the  criminal  defense  counsel,  do  not concede  anything.    Make  the  prosecutor prove  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  every element  of  every  offense  charged  against your client. </p>
<p>41. </p>
<p>It's  the  prosecutor's  job  at  trial,  not  the criminal  defense  counsel's,  to  create  an error-free trial record. </p>
<p>42. </p>
<p>It's the criminal defense counsel's job at trial to  achieve  a  finding  of  not  guilty  for  your Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>client, not to intentionally introduce errors at the trial court level to be later argued on appeal. </p>
<p>43. </p>
<p>Criminal  defense  counsel  who  have  never been  prosecutors  are  more  cynical  of  and have less faith in the criminal justice system than those who once were prosecutors. </p>
<p>44. </p>
<p>It  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that,  as  the accused's criminal defense counsel, you are all that stands between that accused and the State or the Federal government's oftentimes massive police and prosecution machinery. </p>
<p>Be  the  zealous  advocate  for  that  accused who you would want defending you if your roles were reversed. </p>
<p>45. </p>
<p>If  a  client  offers  to  pay  you  now  or  later, choose now. </p>
<p>46. </p>
<p>Leave it at the office. </p>
<p/>
<p>78</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>47. </p>
<p>Don't  join  anything  for  possible  client acquisition  reasons,  join–and  partici-pate–because    you  enjoy  and  support  the activity. </p>
<p>48. </p>
<p>No  loose  pages.    For  want  of  a  nail  the Kingdom was lost. </p>
<p>49. </p>
<p>If it's costing your client money, remember the law of diminishing returns. </p>
<p>50. </p>
<p>Have  an  office  celebration  tradition, including  toasts,  to  share  successes  with your staff. </p>
<p>51. </p>
<p>No one should ever answer a call from the media or the press except you. </p>
<p>52. </p>
<p>As often as possible tell your secretary and your staff why you are doing what you are doing.  Forcing  yourself  to  explain  the reasoning of your decisions not only helps to ensure that you've thought them through, but  also  provides  your  staff  with  a  better Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>understanding of what it is that you expect from them. </p>
<p>53. </p>
<p>Help your client understand why it may be shortsighted  to  allow  the  other  side  to prepare the initial document.  In the <i> Battle</i> <i>of  the  Forms</i>  versus  the  <i>Battle  of  the  Bills</i> discussions  with  your  client,  you  should understand  that  your  client's  argument  is that the legal bills are real and must be paid now,  whereas  your  proposed  document language,  anticipating  possible  hypotheti-cals and determining now how to deal with them, may be a lesser priority to your client. </p>
<p>W ork  hard  and  efficiently  to  find  the compromise  language  that  reasonably protects your client, but that's not  <i>overkill </i> or <i>overbill</i>. </p>
<p>54. </p>
<p>It is the unusual business deal that is driven by tax purposes or principally done for tax reasons.    A  business  deal  should  be  legal and make sense for sound financial reasons 80</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>first,  and  then,  of  course,  have  acceptable tax consequences. </p>
<p>55. </p>
<p>Always </p>
<p>consider </p>
<p>the </p>
<p>potential </p>
<p>tax</p>
<p>consequences of your clients' matters.  If the possible  risks  or  the  possible  rewards  are high,  then  have  competent  tax  counsel provide  their  opinion  to  you  and  your clients  before you  recommend  and  choose any course of action. </p>
<p>56. </p>
<p>Don't  require  that  a  prospective  employee already  be  a  trained  legal  secretary.    Be willing  to  train  someone  if  they  have  the intelligence, the enthusiasm, and the desire to learn and to work with you.  It's worth the additional  effort  to  train  staff  your  way, rather than to retrain someone else's staff. </p>
<p>57. </p>
<p>To see whether duplicate originals or copies are, in fact, exactly the same, put two of the pages with the same page number together, one on top of the other, and then hold them up  to  a  light  source.    If  they  are  identical, Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>each letter will overlap perfectly and it will be obvious with just a glance.  If they're not identical, be glad you've done your job. </p>
<p>58. </p>
<p>If  some  of  the  words  on  a  copy  of  a document  provided  to  you  are  very  light, you can enhance their readability by going over them with a highlighter. </p>
<p>59. </p>
<p>Remember,  no  matter  how  honorable  and meritorious  your  efforts  may  be  for  your clients, the practice of law is a business, not a charity.  Your family expects you to make enough money to maintain, if not improve, their  standard  of  living.    Don't  disappoint them. </p>
<p>60. </p>
<p>Getting  paid  as  a  trial  lawyer  is  very important because the judge will not release you as trial counsel, either civil or criminal, unless there is substitute counsel to replace you.    (And  good  luck  finding  substitute counsel  when  you  tell  them  you're  not getting paid.)</p>

<p>Good  lawyers  recognize  other  good  lawyers. </p>
<p>T hey can be found in every jurisdiction, in every courthouse, and in every law firm in the Country. </p>
<p>But how can clients find a good lawyer?  How  <i>does</i> a client spot and cut a  good lawyer from the rest of the  herd?    Are  there  similar  traits  and  principles that all good lawyers try to follow?  I think there are. </p>
<p>I also think that if clients know what those traits and principles are and look for them in their own  lawyers,  they  will  have  objective  ways  to measure their own lawyer's good lawyering skills. </p>
<p>T his  objective  analysis  should  be  done simultaneously with their subjective measurement 91</p>

<p>standards.  So that we're all clear on what I've done here,  I've  taken  some  of  the  guideposts  from   <i>A</i> <i>Good  Lawyer  </i> and  restated  them  as  traits  and principles you should look for in your lawyer.  If you've  personally  had  a  lawyer,  or  now  have  a lawyer, I'm optimistic that you'll find that not only are you personally satisfied, or even very satisfied, with your own lawyer's work, but that you will also rank  your  lawyer,  objectively,  as  a  good  lawyer, too.  That's because most lawyers really are good lawyers. </p>
<p>Here  then  are  some  of  the  traits  and principles of a good lawyer. </p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
A good lawyer:
<p>1. </p>
<p>Is always honest and truthful. </p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>Listens; and speaks sincerely, or not at all. </p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>Is the messenger, not the message. </p>
<p/>
<p>94</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>4. </p>
<p>Knows  who  the  client  is,  remembers  who the client is, only represents the client, and doesn't surprise the client. </p>
<p>5. </p>
<p>Keeps the client aware of developments in a timely manner. </p>
<p>6. </p>
<p>Returns the client's phone calls and inquiries promptly. </p>
<p>7. </p>
<p>Proposes legit</p>

<p>n -</p>
<p>a tives</p>
<p>to get the client to the desired end result and argues  for  their  adoption.    Makes  deals, doesn't  break  them.    A  good  lawyer  is  a <i>closer</i>. </p>
<p>8. </p>
<p>Asks  the  client  what  the  client  wants  and why.    After  hearing  that  answer,  a  good lawyer  then  tells  the  client  whether  that lawyer  believes  they  can  help  the  client achieve those goals. </p>
<p/>
<p>Stephen W . Comiskey</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>9. </p>
<p>Is  willing  to  tell  the  client  that  the  law sometimes doesn't offer a remedy to every particular problem. </p>
<p>10. </p>
<p>After hearing the situation and accepting the responsibilities of taking on the case, a good lawyer  then  tells  the  client  that  is  it  that lawyer  who  will  now  worry  that  problem, not that client anymore, and that that client needs  to  move  on  to  protect  and  preserve their family, their job, and their work. </p>
<p>11. </p>
<p>Never  underestimates  an  opponent  and never embarrasses anyone. </p>
<p>12. </p>
<p>Has  a  positive  attitude,  is enthusiastic  and creative, but does not promise success. </p>
<p>13. </p>
<p>Explains everything discussed in terms that the  client  can  understand  and  doesn't  use legal terms without explaining them. </p>
<p/>
<p>96</p>
<p>A Good Lawyer</p>
<p>14. </p>
<p>Has  a  good  reputation  with  their  fellow lawyers  and  in  the  local  community  in general. </p>
<p>15. </p>
<p>Doesn't wait for things to happen, but has a flexible plan and begins executing that plan as soon as reasonably possible. </p>
<p>16. </p>
<p>Is unique, but not flamboyant or outrageous. </p>
<p>17. </p>
<p>Before beginning any work, makes sure the client  understands  and  agrees  with  the  fee arrangements  a</p>

<p>M aintains  their  objectivity  about  the  client's case.  Good lawyers may be passionate about their cases, but they remain objective. </p>

<p>49. </p>
<p>Encourages the client to continue to trust the client's  own  instincts  and  to  question  the lawyer  when  the  client  is  unsure  of  what  or why things are or are not happening. </p>
<p>50. </p>
<p>Knows  that  our  democratic  society  and  our justice system within our democracy will only last  as  long  as  we  all  continue  to  recognize that  the  personal  dignity  of  each  individual, even of the  meekest or the vilest amongst us, requires our equal treatment of every one of us under  our  laws.    This  is  the  good  lawyer's gospel.    American  lawyers  are  prepared  to fight and to die for it. </p>
<p>The  inescapable  conclusion  about  a  good lawyer is that the more a client knows about and works with  that  lawyer,  the  more  comfortable  and  confident that client becomes with that lawyer and especially with that lawyer's competence to handle that matter for that client. </p>
